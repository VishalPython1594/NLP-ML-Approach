       "'Artificial intelligence\\n\\nArtificial  intelligence  (AI),  in  its  broadest  sense,  is  intelligence  exhibited  by  machines,  particularly\\ncomputer  systems.  It  is  a  field  of  research  in  computer  science  that  develops  and  studies  methods  and\\nsoftware  that  enable  machines  to  perceive  their  environment  and  use  learning  and  intelligence  to  take\\nactions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1] Such machines may be called AIs.\\n\\nSome  high-profile  applications  of  AI  include  advanced  web  search  engines  (e.g.,  Google  Search);\\nrecommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g.,\\nGoogle  Assistant,  Siri,  and  Alexa);  autonomous  vehicles  (e.g.,  Waymo);  generative  and  creative  tools\\n(e.g.,  ChatGPT,  and AI  art);  and  superhuman  play  and  analysis  in  strategy  games  (e.g.,  chess  and  Go).\\nHowever, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general\\napplications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common\\nenough it\\'s not labeled AI anymore.\"[2][3]\\n\\nThe various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools.\\nThe  traditional  goals  of  AI  research  include  reasoning,  knowledge  representation,  planning,  learning,\\nnatural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] General intelligence—the ability to\\ncomplete  any  task  performable  by  a  human  on  an  at  least  equal  level—is  among  the  field\\'s  long-term\\ngoals.[4]  To  reach  these  goals, AI  researchers  have  adapted  and  integrated  a  wide  range  of  techniques,\\nincluding  search  and  mathematical  optimization,  formal  logic,  artificial  neural  networks,  and  methods\\nbased  on  statistics,  operations  research,  and  economics.[b] AI  also  draws  upon  psychology,  linguistics,\\nphilosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.[5]\\n\\nArtificial  intelligence  was  founded  as  an  academic  discipline  in  1956,[6]  and  the  field  went  through\\nmultiple cycles of optimism,[7][8] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as\\nAI  winter.[9][10]  Funding  and  interest  vastly  increased  after  2012  when  deep  learning  outperformed\\nprevious  AI  techniques.[11]  This  growth  accelerated  further  after  2017  with  the \\ntransformer\\narchitecture,[12] and by the early 2020s hundreds of billions of dollars were being invested in AI (known\\nas  the  \"AI  boom\").  The  widespread  use  of  AI  in  the  21st  century  exposed  several  unintended\\nconsequences  and  harms  in  the  present  and  raised  concerns  about  its  risks  and  long-term  effects  in  the\\nfuture,  prompting  discussions  about  regulatory  policies  to  ensure  the  safety  and  benefits  of  the\\ntechnology.\\n\\nGoals\\n\\nThe  general  problem  of  simulating  (or  creating)  intelligence  has  been  broken  into  subproblems.  These\\nconsist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits\\ndescribed below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.[a]\\n\\nReasoning and problem-solving\\n\\n\\x0cEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they\\nsolve puzzles or make logical deductions.[13] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for\\ninformation,  employing  concepts  from  probability  and\\ndealing  with  uncertain  or \\neconomics.[14]\\n\\nincomplete \\n\\nMany of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a\\n\"combinatorial  explosion\":  They  become  exponentially  slower  as  the  problems  grow.[15]  Even  humans\\nrarely  use  the  step-by-step  deduction  that  early  AI  research  could  model.  They  solve  most  of  their\\nproblems using fast, intuitive judgments.[16] Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\\n\\nKnowledge representation\\nKnowledge  representation  and  knowledge  engineering[17]\\nallow  AI  programs  to  answer  questions  intelligently  and\\nmake deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge\\nrepresentations  are  used  in  content-based  indexing  and\\nretrieval,[18]  scene \\ninterpretation,[19]  clinical  decision\\nsupport,[20]  knowledge  discovery  (mining  \"interesting\"  and\\nactionable  inferences  from  large  databases),[21]  and  other\\nareas.[22]\\n\\nA knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a\\nform that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set\\nof  objects,  relations,  concepts,  and  properties  used  by  a\\nparticular domain of knowledge.[23] Knowledge bases need\\nto  represent  things  such  as  objects,  properties,  categories,\\nand  relations  between  objects;[24]  situations,  events,  states,\\nand  time;[25]  causes  and  effects;[26]  knowledge  about\\nknowledge  (what  we  know  about  what  other  people\\nknow);[27] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will\\nremain true even when other facts are changing);[28] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.\\n\\nAn ontology represents knowledge as a set\\nof concepts within a domain and the\\nrelationships between those concepts.\\n\\nAmong  the  most  difficult  problems  in  knowledge  representation  are  the  breadth  of  commonsense\\nknowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);[29] and the sub-symbolic\\nform  of  most  commonsense  knowledge  (much  of  what  people  know  is  not  represented  as  \"facts\"  or\\n\"statements\" that they could express verbally).[16] There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition,\\nthe problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.[c]\\n\\nPlanning and decision-making\\n\\nAn  \"agent\"  is  anything  that  perceives  and  takes  actions  in  the  world.  A  rational  agent  has  goals  or\\npreferences and takes actions to make them happen.[d][32] In automated planning, the agent has a specific\\ngoal.[33]  In  automated  decision-making,  the  agent  has  preferences—there  are  some  situations  it  would\\nprefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to\\neach situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action,\\n\\n\\x0cit can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the\\nprobability  that  the  outcome  will  occur.  It  can  then  choose  the  action  with  the  maximum  expected\\nutility.[34]\\n\\nIn classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.[35] In most real-world\\nproblems,  however,  the  agent  may  not  be  certain  about  the  situation  they  are  in  (it  is  \"unknown\"  or\\n\"unobservable\")  and  it  may  not  know  for  certain  what  will  happen  after  each  possible  action  (it  is  not\\n\"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation\\nto see if the action worked.[36]\\n\\nIn  some  problems,  the  agent\\'s  preferences  may  be  uncertain,  especially  if  there  are  other  agents  or\\nhumans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning), or the agent can seek\\ninformation  to  improve  its  preferences.[37]  Information  value  theory  can  be  used  to  weigh  the  value  of\\nexploratory  or  experimental  actions.[38]  The  space  of  possible  future  actions  and  situations  is  typically\\nintractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the\\noutcome will be.\\n\\nA Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action\\nwill change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and\\nthe  cost  of  each  action.  A  policy  associates  a  decision  with  each  possible  state.  The  policy  could  be\\ncalculated (e.g., by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.[39]\\n\\nGame theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that\\nmake decisions that involve other agents.[40]\\n\\nLearning\\n\\nMachine  learning  is  the  study  of  programs  that  can  improve  their  performance  on  a  given  task\\nautomatically.[41] It has been a part of AI from the beginning.[e]\\n\\nThere are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds\\npatterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.[44] Supervised learning requires a human to\\nlabel the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to\\npredict  what  category  the  input  belongs  in)  and  regression  (where  the  program  must  deduce  a  numeric\\nfunction based on numeric input).[45]\\n\\nIn reinforcement learning, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent\\nlearns  to  choose  responses  that  are  classified  as  \"good\".[46]  Transfer  learning  is  when  the  knowledge\\ngained from one problem is applied to a new problem.[47] Deep learning is a type of machine learning\\nthat  runs  inputs  through  biologically  inspired  artificial  neural  networks  for  all  of  these  types  of\\nlearning.[48]\\n\\nComputational  learning  theory  can  assess  learners  by  computational  complexity,  by  sample  complexity\\n(how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.[49]\\n\\nNatural language processing\\n\\n\\x0cNatural  language  processing  (NLP)[50]  allows  programs  to  read,  write  and  communicate  in  human\\nlanguages  such  as  English.  Specific  problems  include  speech  recognition,  speech  synthesis,  machine\\ntranslation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering.[51]\\n\\nEarly work, based on Noam Chomsky\\'s generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with\\nword-sense  disambiguation[f]  unless  restricted  to  small  domains  called  \"micro-worlds\"  (due  to  the\\ncommon  sense  knowledge  problem[29]).  Margaret  Masterman  believed  that  it  was  meaning  and  not\\ngrammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the\\nbasis of computational language structure.\\n\\nModern  deep  learning  techniques  for  NLP  include  word  embedding  (representing  words,  typically  as\\nvectors  encoding  their  meaning),[52]  transformers  (a  deep  learning  architecture  using  an  attention\\nmechanism),[53] and others.[54] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models\\nbegan to generate coherent text,[55][56] and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on\\nthe bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications.[57]\\n\\nPerception\\n\\nMachine  perception  is  the  ability  to  use  input  from  sensors  (such  as  cameras,  microphones,  wireless\\nsignals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is\\nthe ability to analyze visual input.[58]\\n\\nincludes  speech  recognition,[59] \\nThe  field \\nrecognition,[61]object tracking,[62] and robotic perception.[63]\\n\\nimage  classification,[60]  facial  recognition,  object\\n\\nSocial intelligence\\n\\nis  an \\n\\ninterdisciplinary  umbrella \\n\\nAffective  computing \\nthat\\ncomprises  systems  that  recognize,  interpret,  process,  or  simulate\\nhuman feeling, emotion, and mood.[65] For example, some virtual\\nassistants  are  programmed  to  speak  conversationally  or  even  to\\nbanter  humorously;  it  makes  them  appear  more  sensitive  to  the\\nemotional  dynamics  of  human  interaction,  or  to  otherwise\\nfacilitate human–computer interaction.\\n\\nHowever, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception\\nof  the  intelligence  of  existing  computer  agents.[66]  Moderate\\nsuccesses related to affective computing include textual sentiment\\nanalysis  and,  more  recently,  multimodal  sentiment  analysis,\\nwherein  AI  classifies  the  affects  displayed  by  a  videotaped\\nsubject.[67]\\n\\nKismet, a robot head which was\\nmade in the 1990s; it is a machine\\nthat can recognize and simulate\\nemotions.[64]\\n\\nGeneral intelligence\\n\\n\\x0cA  machine  with  artificial  general  intelligence  should  be  able  to  solve  a  wide  variety  of  problems  with\\nbreadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.[4]\\n\\nTechniques\\n\\nAI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.[b]\\n\\nSearch and optimization\\nAI  can  solve  many  problems  by  intelligently  searching  through  many  possible  solutions.[68]  There  are\\ntwo very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search.\\n\\nState space search\\nState space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state.[69] For example,\\nplanning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal,\\na process called means-ends analysis.[70]\\n\\nSimple exhaustive searches[71] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the\\nnumber of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow\\nor never completes.[15] \"Heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to\\nreach a goal.[72]\\n\\nAdversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of\\npossible moves and counter-moves, looking for a winning position.[73]\\n\\nLocal search\\n\\nLocal search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a\\nproblem.  It  begins  with  some  form  of  guess  and  refines  it\\nincrementally.[74]\\n\\nGradient  descent  is  a  type  of  local  search  that  optimizes  a  set  of\\nnumerical  parameters  by \\nto\\nminimize  a  loss  function.  Variants  of  gradient  descent  are\\ncommonly used to train neural networks.[75]\\n\\nincrementally  adjusting \\n\\nthem \\n\\nAnother  type  of  local  search  is  evolutionary  computation,  which\\naims  to  iteratively  improve  a  set  of  candidate  solutions  by\\n\"mutating\"  and  \"recombining\"  them,  selecting  only  the  fittest  to\\nsurvive each generation.[76]\\n\\nIllustration of gradient descent for 3\\ndifferent starting points; two\\nparameters (represented by the plan\\ncoordinates) are adjusted in order to\\nminimize the loss function (the\\nheight)\\n\\n\\x0cDistributed  search  processes  can  coordinate  via  swarm  intelligence  algorithms.  Two  popular  swarm\\nalgorithms  used  in  search  are  particle  swarm  optimization  (inspired  by  bird  flocking)  and  ant  colony\\noptimization (inspired by ant trails).[77]\\n\\nLogic\\nFormal  logic  is  used  for  reasoning  and  knowledge  representation.[78]  Formal  logic  comes  in  two  main\\nforms:  propositional  logic  (which  operates  on  statements  that  are  true  or  false  and  uses  logical\\nconnectives  such  as  \"and\",  \"or\",  \"not\"  and  \"implies\")[79]  and  predicate  logic  (which  also  operates  on\\nobjects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as \"Every X is a Y\" and \"There are some Xs that\\nare Ys\").[80]\\n\\nDeductive  reasoning  in  logic  is  the  process  of  proving  a  new  statement  (conclusion)  from  other\\nstatements  that  are  given  and  assumed  to  be  true  (the  premises).[81]  Proofs  can  be  structured  as  proof\\ntrees,  in  which  nodes  are  labelled  by  sentences,  and  children  nodes  are  connected  to  parent  nodes  by\\ninference rules.\\n\\nGiven a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root\\nnode is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms. In\\nthe  case  of  Horn  clauses,  problem-solving  search  can  be  performed  by  reasoning  forwards  from  the\\npremises or backwards from the problem.[82] In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order\\nlogic,  resolution  is  a  single,  axiom-free  rule  of  inference,  in  which  a  problem  is  solved  by  proving  a\\ncontradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.[83]\\n\\nInference  in  both  Horn  clause  logic  and  first-order  logic  is  undecidable,  and  therefore  intractable.\\nHowever,  backward  reasoning  with  Horn  clauses,  which  underpins  computation  in  the  logic\\nprogramming  language  Prolog,  is  Turing  complete.  Moreover,  its  efficiency  is  competitive  with\\ncomputation in other symbolic programming languages.[84]\\n\\nFuzzy  logic  assigns  a  \"degree  of  truth\"  between  0  and  1.  It  can  therefore  handle  propositions  that  are\\nvague and partially true.[85]\\n\\nNon-monotonic  logics,  including  logic  programming  with  negation  as  failure,  are  designed  to  handle\\ndefault reasoning.[28] Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex\\ndomains.\\n\\nProbabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning\\n\\nMany  problems  in AI  (including  in  reasoning,  planning,  learning,  perception,  and  robotics)  require  the\\nagent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools\\nto solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.[86] Precise mathematical\\ntools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory,\\ndecision  analysis,[87]  and  information  value  theory.[88]  These  tools  include  models  such  as  Markov\\ndecision processes,[89] dynamic decision networks,[90] game theory and mechanism design.[91]\\n\\nBayesian  networks[92]  are  a  tool  that  can  be  used  for  reasoning  (using  the  Bayesian  inference\\nalgorithm),[g][94] learning (using the expectation–maximization algorithm),[h][96] planning (using decision\\nnetworks)[97] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).[90]\\n\\n\\x0cProbabilistic  algorithms  can  also  be  used\\nfor  filtering,  prediction,  smoothing,  and\\nfinding  explanations  for  streams  of  data,\\nthus  helping  perception  systems  analyze\\nprocesses that occur over time (e.g., hidden\\nMarkov models or Kalman filters).[90]\\n\\nClassifiers and statistical\\nlearning methods\\n\\nA simple Bayesian network, with the associated conditional\\nprobability tables\\n\\nThe  simplest  AI  applications  can  be\\ndivided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if\\nshiny  then  diamond\"),  on  one  hand,  and\\ncontrollers  (e.g.,  \"if  diamond  then  pick\\nup\"), on the other hand. Classifiers[98] are functions that use\\npattern  matching  to  determine  the  closest  match.  They  can\\nbe  fine-tuned  based  on  chosen  examples  using  supervised\\nlearning.  Each  pattern  (also  called  an  \"observation\")  is\\nlabeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations\\ncombined  with  their  class  labels  are  known  as  a  data  set.\\nWhen  a  new  observation  is  received,  that  observation  is\\nclassified based on previous experience.[45]\\n\\nThere are many kinds of classifiers in use.[99] The decision\\ntree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine\\nlearning  algorithm.[100]  K-nearest  neighbor  algorithm  was\\nthe most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and\\nKernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM)\\ndisplaced  k-nearest  neighbor  in  the  1990s.[101]  The  naive\\nBayes  classifier  is  reportedly  the  \"most  widely  used\\nlearner\"[102]  at  Google,  due  in  part  to  its  scalability.[103]\\nNeural networks are also used as classifiers.[104]\\n\\nExpectation–maximization clustering of Old\\nFaithful eruption data starts from a random\\nguess but then successfully converges on\\nan accurate clustering of the two physically\\ndistinct modes of eruption.\\n\\nArtificial neural networks\\n\\nAn  artificial  neural  network  is  based  on  a  collection  of  nodes  also  known  as  artificial  neurons,  which\\nloosely  model  the  neurons  in  a  biological  brain.  It  is  trained  to  recognise  patterns;  once  trained,  it  can\\nrecognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output.\\nEach node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to\\nthe next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.[104]\\n\\nLearning  algorithms  for  neural  networks  use  local  search  to  choose  the  weights  that  will  get  the  right\\noutput  for  each  input  during  training.  The  most  common  training  technique  is  the  backpropagation\\nalgorithm.[105]  Neural  networks  learn  to  model  complex  relationships  between  inputs  and  outputs  and\\nfind patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.[106]\\n\\n\\x0cIn  feedforward  neural  networks  the  signal  passes  in  only  one\\ndirection.[107]  Recurrent  neural  networks  feed  the  output  signal\\nback into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous\\ninput  events.  Long  short  term  memory  is  the  most  successful\\nnetwork  architecture  for  recurrent  networks.[108]  Perceptrons[109]\\nuse only a single layer of neurons; deep learning[110] uses multiple\\nlayers.  Convolutional  neural  networks  strengthen  the  connection\\nbetween neurons that are \"close\" to each other—this is especially\\nimportant in image processing, where a local set of neurons must\\nidentify an \"edge\" before the network can identify an object.[111]\\n\\nA neural network is an\\ninterconnected group of nodes, akin\\nto the vast network of neurons in the\\nhuman brain.\\n\\nDeep learning\\nDeep  learning[110]  uses  several  layers  of  neurons  between  the  network\\'s\\ninputs  and  outputs. The  multiple  layers  can  progressively  extract  higher-\\nlevel features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower\\nlayers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts\\nrelevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces.[112]\\n\\nspeech \\n\\nrecognition,  natural \\n\\nlanguage  processing, \\n\\nDeep  learning  has  profoundly  improved  the  performance  of  programs  in\\nmany  important  subfields  of  artificial  intelligence,  including  computer\\nvision, \\nimage\\nclassification,[113]  and  others. The  reason  that  deep  learning  performs  so\\nwell in so many applications is not known as of 2023.[114] The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–\\n2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and\\nbackpropagation  had  been  described  by  many  people,  as  far  back  as  the  1950s)[i]  but  because  of  two\\nfactors:  the  incredible  increase  in  computer  power  (including  the  hundred-fold  increase  in  speed  by\\nswitching  to  GPUs)  and  the  availability  of  vast  amounts  of  training  data,  especially  the  giant  curated\\ndatasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet.[j]\\n\\nGPT\\n\\nGenerative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on\\nthe semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pretrained on a large\\ncorpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token\\nbeing  usually  a  word,  subword,  or  punctuation).  Throughout  this  pretraining,  GPT  models  accumulate\\nknowledge  about  the  world  and  can  then  generate  human-like  text  by  repeatedly  predicting  the  next\\ntoken.  Typically,  a  subsequent  training  phase  makes  the  model  more  truthful,  useful,  and  harmless,\\nusually  with  a  technique  called  reinforcement  learning  from  human  feedback  (RLHF).  Current  GPT\\nmodels  are  prone  to  generating  falsehoods  called  \"hallucinations\",  although  this  can  be  reduced  with\\nRLHF and quality data. They are used in chatbots, which allow people to ask a question or request a task\\nin simple text.[122][123]\\n\\n\\x0cCurrent  models  and  services  include  Gemini  (formerly  Bard),  ChatGPT,  Grok,  Claude,  Copilot,  and\\nLLaMA.[124]  Multimodal  GPT  models  can  process  different  types  of  data  (modalities)  such  as  images,\\nvideos, sound, and text.[125]\\n\\nHardware and software\\n\\nIn  the  late  2010s,  graphics  processing  units  (GPUs)  that  were  increasingly  designed  with  AI-specific\\nenhancements  and  used  with  specialized  TensorFlow  software  had  replaced  previously  used  central\\nprocessing  unit  (CPUs)  as  the  dominant  means  for  large-scale  (commercial  and  academic)  machine\\nlearning models\\' training.[126] Specialized programming languages such as Prolog were used in early AI\\nresearch,[127] but general-purpose programming languages like Python have become predominant.[128]\\n\\nThe  transistor  density  in  integrated  circuits  has  been  observed  to  roughly  double  every  18  months—a\\ntrend  known  as  Moore\\'s  law,  named  after  the  Intel  co-founder  Gordon  Moore,  who  first  identified  it.\\nImprovements in GPUs have been even faster.[129]\\n\\nApplications\\n\\nAI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including:\\nsearch  engines  (such  as  Google  Search),  targeting  online  advertisements,  recommendation  systems\\n(offered  by  Netflix,  YouTube  or  Amazon),  driving  internet  traffic,  targeted  advertising  (AdSense,\\nFacebook), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa), autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and\\nself-driving  cars),  automatic  language  translation  (Microsoft  Translator,  Google  Translate),  facial\\nrecognition (Apple\\'s Face ID or Microsoft\\'s DeepFace and Google\\'s FaceNet) and image labeling (used\\nby Facebook, Apple\\'s iPhoto and TikTok). The deployment of AI may be overseen by a Chief automation\\nofficer (CAO).\\n\\nHealth and medicine\\n\\nThe  application  of AI  in  medicine  and  medical  research  has  the  potential  to  increase  patient  care  and\\nquality  of  life.[130]  Through  the  lens  of  the  Hippocratic  Oath,  medical  professionals  are  ethically\\ncompelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients.[131][132]\\n\\nFor medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data. This is particularly\\nimportant  for  organoid  and  tissue  engineering  development  which  use  microscopy  imaging  as  a  key\\ntechnique  in  fabrication.[133]  It  has  been  suggested  that  AI  can  overcome  discrepancies  in  funding\\nallocated to different fields of research.[133] New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically\\nrelevant  pathways.  For  example, AlphaFold  2  (2021)  demonstrated  the  ability  to  approximate,  in  hours\\nrather  than  months,  the  3D  structure  of  a  protein.[134]  In  2023,  it  was  reported  that  AI-guided  drug\\ndiscovery  helped  find  a  class  of  antibiotics  capable  of  killing  two  different  types  of  drug-resistant\\nbacteria.[135] In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson\\'s disease\\n\\n\\x0cdrug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-\\nsynuclein  (the  protein  that  characterises  Parkinson\\'s  disease).  They  were  able  to  speed  up  the  initial\\nscreening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold.[136][137]\\n\\nGames\\n\\nGame  playing  programs  have  been  used  since  the  1950s  to  demonstrate  and  test  AI\\'s  most  advanced\\ntechniques.[138] Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess\\nchampion,  Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.[139] In 2011, in a  Jeopardy!  quiz show exhibition match,\\nIBM\\'s question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter\\nand Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.[140] In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a\\nmatch  with  Go  champion  Lee  Sedol,  becoming  the  first  computer  Go-playing  system  to  beat  a\\nprofessional Go player without handicaps. Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player\\nin  the  world.[141]  Other  programs  handle  imperfect-information  games,  such  as  the  poker-playing\\nprogram  Pluribus.[142]  DeepMind  developed  increasingly  generalistic  reinforcement  learning  models,\\nsuch as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games.[143] In 2019, DeepMind\\'s\\nAlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game\\nthat involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map.[144] In 2021, an AI agent competed in a\\nPlayStation  Gran  Turismo  competition,  winning  against  four  of  the  world\\'s  best  Gran  Turismo  drivers\\nusing  deep  reinforcement  learning.[145]  In  2024,  Google  DeepMind  introduced  SIMA,  a  type  of  AI\\ncapable  of  autonomously  playing  nine  previously  unseen  open-world  video  games  by  observing  screen\\noutput, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions.[146]\\n\\nMathematics\\n\\nIn mathematics, special forms of formal step-by-step reasoning are used. In contrast, LLMs such as GPT-\\n4 Turbo, Gemini Ultra, Claude Opus, LLaMa-2 or Mistral Large are working with probabilistic models,\\nwhich  can  produce  wrong  answers  in  the  form  of  hallucinations. Therefore,  they  need  not  only  a  large\\ndatabase  of  mathematical  problems  to  learn  from  but  also  methods  such  as  supervised  fine-tuning  or\\ntrained  classifiers  with  human-annotated  data  to  improve  answers  for  new  problems  and  learn  from\\ncorrections.[147]  A  2024  study  showed  that  the  performance  of  some  language  models  for  reasoning\\ncapabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with\\nonly minor deviations from trained data.[148]\\n\\nAlternatively,  dedicated  models  for  mathematic  problem  solving  with  higher  precision  for  the  outcome\\nincluding  proof  of  theorems  have  been  developed  such  as  Alpha  Tensor,  Alpha  Geometry  and  Alpha\\nProof all from Google DeepMind,[149] Llemma from eleuther[150] or Julius.[151]\\n\\nWhen  natural  language  is  used  to  describe  mathematical  problems,  converters  transform  such  prompts\\ninto a formal language such as Lean to define mathematic tasks.\\n\\nSome models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark\\ntests, others to serve as educational tools in mathematics.[152]\\n\\nFinance\\n\\n\\x0cFinance  is  one  of  the  fastest  growing  sectors  where  applied  AI  tools  are  being  deployed:  from  retail\\nonline banking to investment advice and insurance, where automated \"robot advisers\" have been in use\\nfor some years.[153]\\n\\nWorld  Pensions  experts  like  Nicolas  Firzli  insist  it  may  be  too  early  to  see  the  emergence  of  highly\\ninnovative AI-informed financial products and services: \"the deployment of AI tools will simply further\\nautomatise things: destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking, financial planning, and pension advice\\nin  the  process,  but  I\\'m  not  sure  it  will  unleash  a  new  wave  of  [e.g.,  sophisticated]  pension\\ninnovation.\"[154]\\n\\nMilitary\\nVarious  countries  are  deploying AI  military  applications.[155] The  main  applications  enhance  command\\nand  control,  communications,  sensors,  integration  and  interoperability.[156]  Research  is  targeting\\nintelligence  collection  and  analysis, \\ninformation  operations,  and\\nsemiautonomous  and  autonomous  vehicles.[155]  AI  technologies  enable  coordination  of  sensors  and\\neffectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination\\nand  deconfliction  of  distributed  Joint  Fires  between  networked  combat  vehicles  involving  manned  and\\nunmanned teams.[156] AI was incorporated into military operations in Iraq and Syria.[155]\\n\\nlogistics,  cyber  operations, \\n\\nIn November 2023, US Vice President Kamala Harris disclosed a declaration signed by 31 nations to set\\nguardrails  for  the  military  use  of  AI.  The  commitments  include  using  legal  reviews  to  ensure  the\\ncompliance of military AI with international laws, and being cautious and transparent in the development\\nof this technology.[157]\\n\\nGenerative AI\\n\\nIn the early 2020s, generative AI gained widespread prominence.\\nGenAI  is AI  capable  of  generating  text,  images,  videos,  or  other\\ndata  using  generative  models,[158][159]  often  in  response  to\\nprompts.[160][161]\\n\\nIn March 2023, 58% of U.S. adults had heard about ChatGPT and\\n14%  had  tried  it.[162]  The  increasing  realism  and  ease-of-use  of\\nAI-based  text-to-image  generators  such  as  Midjourney,  DALL-E,\\nand Stable Diffusion sparked a trend of viral AI-generated photos.\\nWidespread attention was gained by a fake photo of Pope Francis\\nwearing a white puffer coat, the fictional arrest of Donald Trump,\\nand  a  hoax  of  an  attack  on  the  Pentagon,  as  well  as  the  usage  in\\nprofessional creative arts.[163][164]\\n\\nVincent van Gogh in watercolour\\ncreated by generative AI software\\n\\nAgents\\n\\nArtificial  intelligent  (AI)  agents  are  software  entities  designed  to  perceive  their  environment,  make\\ndecisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. These agents can interact with users,\\ntheir environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants,\\nchatbots, autonomous vehicles, game-playing systems, and industrial robotics. AI agents operate within\\n\\n\\x0cthe constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This\\nmeans  they  are  restricted  to  performing  tasks  within  their  defined  scope  and  have  finite  memory  and\\nprocessing  capabilities.  In  real-world  applications,  AI  agents  often  face  time  constraints  for  decision-\\nmaking and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve\\ntheir performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt\\nto new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks.[165][166][167]\\n\\nOther industry-specific tasks\\n\\nThere  are  also  thousands  of  successful  AI  applications  used  to  solve  specific  problems  for  specific\\nindustries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated \"AI\" in\\nsome  offerings  or  processes.[168]  A  few  examples  are  energy  storage,  medical  diagnosis,  military\\nlogistics,  applications  that  predict  the  result  of  judicial  decisions,  foreign  policy,  or  supply  chain\\nmanagement.\\n\\nAI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing. AI has been used to investigate if\\nand  how  people  evacuated  in  large  scale  and  small  scale  evacuations  using  historical  data  from  GPS,\\nvideos  or  social  media.  Further,  AI  can  provide  real  time  information  on  the  real  time  evacuation\\nconditions.[169][170][171]\\n\\nIn agriculture, AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments\\nor increasing yield. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict\\nthe ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct\\npredictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests,\\nand save water.\\n\\nArtificial  intelligence  is  used  in  astronomy  to  analyze  increasing  amounts  of  available  data  and\\napplications, mainly for \"classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the\\ndevelopment of new scientific insights.\" For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting\\nsolar  activity,  and  distinguishing  between  signals  and  instrumental  effects  in  gravitational  wave\\nastronomy. Additionally, it could be used for activities in space, such as space exploration, including the\\nanalysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance,\\nand more autonomous operation.\\n\\nDuring the 2024 Indian elections, US$50 millions was spent on authorized AI-generated content, notably\\nby creating deepfakes of allied (including sometimes deceased) politicians to better engage with voters,\\nand by translating speeches to various local languages.[172]\\n\\nEthics\\n\\nAI has potential benefits and potential risks.[173] AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for\\nserious problems: Demis Hassabis of Deep Mind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve\\neverything  else\".[174]  However,  as  the  use  of  AI  has  become  widespread,  several  unintended\\n\\n\\x0cconsequences and risks have been identified.[175] In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics\\nand bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable\\nin deep learning.[176]\\n\\nRisks and harm\\n\\nPrivacy and copyright\\n\\nMachine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have\\nraised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright.\\n\\nAI-powered  devices  and  services,  such  as  virtual  assistants  and  IoT  products,  continuously  collect\\npersonal  information,  raising  concerns  about  intrusive  data  gathering  and  unauthorized  access  by  third\\nparties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI\\'s ability to process and combine vast amounts of\\ndata, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and\\nanalyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency.\\n\\nSensitive  user  data  collected  may  include  online  activity  records,  geolocation  data,  video  or  audio.[177]\\nFor example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private\\nconversations  and  allowed  temporary  workers  to  listen  to  and  transcribe  some  of  them.[178]  Opinions\\nabout this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is\\nclearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy.[179]\\n\\nAI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications. and have developed several\\ntechniques  that  attempt  to  preserve  privacy  while  still  obtaining  the  data,  such  as  data  aggregation,  de-\\nidentification  and  differential  privacy.[180]  Since  2016,  some  privacy  experts,  such  as  Cynthia  Dwork,\\nhave begun to view privacy in terms of fairness. Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted \"from\\nthe question of \\'what they know\\' to the question of \\'what they\\'re doing with it\\'.\"[181]\\n\\nGenerative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or\\ncomputer code; the output is then used under the rationale of \"fair use\". Experts disagree about how well\\nand under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include\\n\"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market\\nfor  the  copyrighted  work\".[182][183] Website  owners  who  do  not  wish  to  have  their  content  scraped  can\\nindicate  it  in  a  \"robots.txt\"  file.[184]  In  2023,  leading  authors  (including  John  Grisham  and  Jonathan\\nFranzen)  sued  AI  companies  for  using  their  work  to  train  generative  AI.[185][186]  Another  discussed\\napproach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure\\nfair attribution and compensation for human authors.[187]\\n\\nDominance by tech giants\\n\\nThe  commercial AI  scene  is  dominated  by  Big Tech  companies  such  as Alphabet  Inc., Amazon, Apple\\nInc., Meta Platforms, and Microsoft.[188][189][190] Some of these players already own the vast majority of\\nexisting cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers, allowing them to entrench further in\\nthe marketplace.[191][192]\\n\\nSubstantial power needs and other environmental impacts\\n\\n\\x0cIn January 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast\\nto  2026,  forecasting  electric  power  use.[193]  This  is  the  first  IEA  report  to  make  projections  for  data\\ncenters and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power\\ndemand  for  these  uses  might  double  by  2026,  with  additional  electric  power  usage  equal  to  electricity\\nused by the whole Japanese nation.[194]\\n\\nProdigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuels use, and might delay\\nclosings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of\\ndata centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon)\\ninto  voracious  consumers  of  electric  power.  Projected  electric  consumption  is  so  immense  that  there  is\\nconcern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the\\nelectrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources – from nuclear\\nenergy  to  geothermal  to  fusion.  The  tech  firms  argue  that  –  in  the  long  view  – AI  will  be  eventually\\nkinder  to  the  environment,  but  they  need  the  energy  now. AI  makes  the  power  grid  more  efficient  and\\n\"intelligent\", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to\\ntechnology firms.[195]\\n\\nA  2024  Goldman  Sachs  Research  Paper,  AI  Data  Centers  and  the  Coming  US  Power  Demand  Surge,\\nfound \"US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation....\" and forecasts that,\\nby 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for\\nthe electrical power generation industry by a variety of means.[196] Data centers\\' need for more and more\\nelectrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that\\nAI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all.[197]\\n\\nIn  2024,  the  Wall  Street  Journal  reported  that  big AI  companies  have  begun  negotiations  with  the  US\\nnuclear  power  providers  to  provide  electricity  to  the  data  centers.  In  March  2024 Amazon  purchased  a\\nPennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for $650 Million (US).[198]\\n\\nIn September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three\\nMile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the\\nplant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in\\n1979,  will  require  Constellation  to  get  through  strict  regulatory  processes  which  will  include  extensive\\nsafety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If approved (this will be the first ever US\\nre-commissioning  of  a  nuclear  plant),  over  835  megawatts  of  power  –  enough  for  800,000  homes  –  of\\nenergy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at $1.6 billion (US) and is\\ndependent  on  tax  breaks  for  nuclear  power  contained  in  the  2022  US  Inflation  Reduction Act.[199] The\\nUS  government  and  the  state  of  Michigan  are  investing  almost  $2  billion  (US)  to  reopen  the  Palisades\\nNuclear  reactor  on  Lake  Michigan.  Closed  since  2022,  the  plant  is  planned  to  be  reopened  in  October\\n2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a\\nnuclear  proponent  and  former  CEO  of  Exelon  who  was  responsible  for  Exelon  spinoff  of\\nConstellation.[200]\\n\\nMisinformation\\n\\nYouTube,  Facebook  and  others  use  recommender  systems  to  guide  users  to  more  content.  These  AI\\nprograms were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people\\nwatching). The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme\\npartisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch\\n\\n\\x0cmore content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple\\nversions of the same misinformation.[201] This convinced many users that the misinformation was true,\\nand ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government.[202] The AI program had\\ncorrectly  learned  to  maximize  its  goal,  but  the  result  was  harmful  to  society. After  the  U.S.  election  in\\n2016, major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem .\\n\\nIn 2022, generative AI began to create images, audio, video and text that are indistinguishable from real\\nphotographs, recordings, films, or human writing. It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to\\ncreate  massive  amounts  of  misinformation  or  propaganda.[203]  AI  pioneer  Geoffrey  Hinton  expressed\\nconcern about AI enabling \"authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates\" on a large scale, among\\nother risks.[204]\\n\\nAlgorithmic bias and fairness\\nMachine learning applications will be biased[k] if they learn from biased data.[206] The developers may\\nnot be aware that the bias exists.[207] Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by\\nthe way a model is deployed.[208][206] If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously\\nharm  people  (as  it  can  in  medicine,  finance,  recruitment,  housing  or  policing)  then  the  algorithm  may\\ncause discrimination.[209] The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases.\\n\\nOn June 28, 2015, Google Photos\\'s new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a\\nfriend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few\\nimages of black people,[210] a problem called \"sample size disparity\".[211] Google \"fixed\" this problem by\\npreventing  the  system  from  labelling  anything  as  a  \"gorilla\".  Eight  years  later,  in  2023,  Google  Photos\\nstill could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and\\nAmazon.[212]\\n\\nCOMPAS  is  a  commercial  program  widely  used  by  U.S.  courts  to  assess  the  likelihood  of  a  defendant\\nbecoming  a  recidivist.  In  2016,  Julia Angwin  at  ProPublica  discovered  that  COMPAS  exhibited  racial\\nbias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for\\nboth whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the\\nsystem  consistently  overestimated  the  chance  that  a  black  person  would  re-offend  and  would\\nunderestimate  the  chance  that  a  white  person  would  not  re-offend.[213]  In  2017,  several  researchers[l]\\nshowed  that  it  was  mathematically  impossible  for  COMPAS  to  accommodate  all  possible  measures  of\\nfairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.[215]\\n\\nA program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature\\n(such  as  \"race\"  or  \"gender\").  The  feature  will  correlate  with  other  features  (like  \"address\",  \"shopping\\nhistory\"  or  \"first  name\"),  and  the  program  will  make  the  same  decisions  based  on  these  features  as  it\\nwould  on  \"race\"  or  \"gender\".[216]  Moritz  Hardt  said  \"the  most  robust  fact  in  this  research  area  is  that\\nfairness through blindness doesn\\'t work.\"[217]\\n\\nCriticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that\\nare only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes\\nthe results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will\\nbe made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations, some of these\\n\\n\\x0c\"recommendations\"  will  likely  be  racist.[218]  Thus,  machine  learning  is  not  well  suited  to  help  make\\ndecisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. It is descriptive rather\\nthan prescriptive.[m]\\n\\nBias  and  unfairness  may  go  undetected  because  the  developers  are  overwhelmingly  white  and  male:\\namong AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.[211]\\n\\nThere are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on\\nethical  assumptions,  and  are  influenced  by  beliefs  about  society.  One  broad  category  is  distributive\\nfairness,  which  focuses  on  the  outcomes,  often  identifying  groups  and  seeking  to  compensate  for\\nstatistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative\\nstereotypes or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather\\nthan the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of\\nAI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult\\nfor companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also\\nconsidered  by  many AI  ethicists  to  be  necessary  in  order  to  compensate  for  biases,  but  it  may  conflict\\nwith anti-discrimination laws.[205]\\n\\nAt  its  2022  Conference  on  Fairness,  Accountability,  and  Transparency  (ACM  FAccT  2022),  the\\nAssociation  for  Computing  Machinery,  in  Seoul,  South  Korea,  presented  and  published  findings  that\\nrecommend  that  until  AI  and  robotics  systems  are  demonstrated  to  be  free  of  bias  mistakes,  they  are\\nunsafe,  and  the  use  of  self-learning  neural  networks  trained  on  vast,  unregulated  sources  of  flawed\\ninternet data should be curtailed.[220]\\n\\nLack of transparency\\nMany AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions.[221]\\nParticularly  with  deep  neural  networks,  in  which  there  are  a  large  amount  of  non-linear  relationships\\nbetween inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist.[222]\\n\\nIt is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works.\\nThere have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless\\nlearned  something  different  than  what  the  programmers  intended.  For  example,  a  system  that  could\\nidentify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to\\nclassify images with a ruler as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to\\nshow  the  scale.[223]  Another  machine  learning  system  designed  to  help  effectively  allocate  medical\\nresources  was  found  to  classify  patients  with  asthma  as  being  at  \"low  risk\"  of  dying  from  pneumonia.\\nHaving  asthma  is  actually  a  severe  risk  factor,  but  since  the  patients  having  asthma  would  usually  get\\nmuch  more  medical  care,  they  were  relatively  unlikely  to  die  according  to  the  training  data.  The\\ncorrelation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.[224]\\n\\nPeople who have been harmed by an algorithm\\'s decision have a right to an explanation.[225] Doctors, for\\nexample,  are  expected  to  clearly  and  completely  explain  to  their  colleagues  the  reasoning  behind  any\\ndecision  they  make.  Early  drafts  of  the  European  Union\\'s  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  in  2016\\nincluded  an  explicit  statement  that  this  right  exists.[n]  Industry  experts  noted  that  this  is  an  unsolved\\nproblem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has\\nno solution, the tools should not be used.[226]\\n\\n\\x0cDARPA established the XAI (\"Explainable Artificial Intelligence\") program in 2014 to try to solve these\\nproblems.[227]\\n\\nSeveral approaches aim to address the transparency problem. SHAP enables to visualise the contribution\\nof  each  feature  to  the  output.[228]  LIME  can  locally  approximate  a  model\\'s  outputs  with  a  simpler,\\ninterpretable model.[229] Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target\\nclassification.  These  other  outputs  can  help  developers  deduce  what  the  network  has  learned.[230]\\nDeconvolution,  DeepDream  and  other  generative  methods  can  allow  developers  to  see  what  different\\nlayers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the\\nnetwork is learning.[231] For generative pre-trained transformers, Anthropic developed a technique based\\non  dictionary  learning  that  associates  patterns  of  neuron  activations  with  human-understandable\\nconcepts.[232]\\n\\nBad actors and weaponized AI\\n\\nArtificial  intelligence  provides  a  number  of  tools  that  are  useful  to  bad  actors,  such  as  authoritarian\\ngovernments, terrorists, criminals or rogue states.\\n\\nA lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human\\nsupervision.[o] Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous\\nweapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction.[234] Even when used\\nin  conventional  warfare,  it  is  unlikely  that  they  will  be  unable  to  reliably  choose  targets  and  could\\npotentially  kill  an  innocent  person.[234]  In  2014,  30  nations  (including  China)  supported  a  ban  on\\nautonomous weapons under the United Nations\\' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however\\nthe United States and others disagreed.[235] By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching\\nbattlefield robots.[236]\\n\\nAI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways.\\nFace  and  voice  recognition  allow  widespread  surveillance.  Machine  learning,  operating  this  data,  can\\nclassify  potential  enemies  of  the  state  and  prevent  them  from  hiding.  Recommendation  systems  can\\nprecisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in\\nproducing  misinformation.  Advanced  AI  can  make  authoritarian  centralized  decision  making  more\\ncompetitive  than  liberal  and  decentralized  systems  such  as  markets.  It  lowers  the  cost  and  difficulty  of\\ndigital  warfare  and  advanced  spyware.[237]  All  these  technologies  have  been  available  since  2020  or\\nearlier—AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China.[238][239]\\n\\nThere many other ways that AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen. For\\nexample,  machine-learning  AI  is  able  to  design  tens  of  thousands  of  toxic  molecules  in  a  matter  of\\nhours.[240]\\n\\nTechnological unemployment\\n\\nEconomists  have  frequently  highlighted  the  risks  of  redundancies  from  AI,  and  speculated  about\\nunemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.[241]\\n\\nIn  the  past,  technology  has  tended  to  increase  rather  than  reduce  total  employment,  but  economists\\nacknowledge  that  \"we\\'re  in  uncharted  territory\"  with  AI.[242]  A  survey  of  economists  showed\\ndisagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-\\n\\n\\x0cterm  unemployment,  but  they  generally  agree  that  it  could  be  a  net  benefit  if  productivity  gains  are\\nredistributed.[243]  Risk  estimates  vary;  for  example,  in  the  2010s,  Michael  Osborne  and  Carl  Benedikt\\nFrey  estimated  47%  of  U.S.  jobs  are  at  \"high  risk\"  of  potential  automation,  while  an  OECD  report\\nclassified  only  9%  of  U.S.  jobs  as  \"high  risk\".[p][245]  The  methodology  of  speculating  about  future\\nemployment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology,\\nrather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies.[241] In April 2023, it was\\nreported  that  70%  of  the  jobs  for  Chinese  video  game  illustrators  had  been  eliminated  by  generative\\nartificial intelligence.[246][247]\\n\\nUnlike  previous  waves  of  automation,  many  middle-class  jobs  may  be  eliminated  by  artificial\\nintelligence;  The  Economist  stated  in  2015  that  \"the  worry  that AI  could  do  to  white-collar  jobs  what\\nsteam  power  did  to  blue-collar  ones  during  the  Industrial  Revolution\"  is  \"worth  taking  seriously\".[248]\\nJobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for\\ncare-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.[249]\\n\\nFrom the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example,\\nthose put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually\\nshould be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative\\ncalculation and qualitative, value-based judgement.[250]\\n\\nExistential risk\\n\\nIt  has  been  argued AI  will  become  so  powerful  that  humanity  may  irreversibly  lose  control  of  it.  This\\ncould, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \"spell the end of the human race\".[251] This scenario has been\\ncommon in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\"\\n(or  \"sentience\"  or  \"consciousness\")  and  becomes  a  malevolent  character.[q]  These  sci-fi  scenarios  are\\nmisleading in several ways.\\n\\nFirst, AI does not require human-like \"sentience\" to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given\\nspecific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if\\none gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it\\n(he used the example of a paperclip factory manager).[253] Stuart Russell gives the example of household\\nrobot  that  tries  to  find  a  way  to  kill  its  owner  to  prevent  it  from  being  unplugged,  reasoning  that  \"you\\ncan\\'t fetch the coffee if you\\'re dead.\"[254] In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have\\nto be genuinely aligned with humanity\\'s morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".[255]\\n\\nSecond, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an\\nexistential  risk.  The  essential  parts  of  civilization  are  not  physical.  Things  like  ideologies,  law,\\ngovernment,  money  and  the  economy  are  made  of  language;  they  exist  because  there  are  stories  that\\nbillions  of  people  believe.  The  current  prevalence  of  misinformation  suggests  that  an  AI  could  use\\nlanguage to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.[256]\\n\\nThe opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and\\nunconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI.[257] Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill\\nGates,  and  Elon  Musk,[258]  as  well  as  AI  pioneers  such  as  Yoshua  Bengio,  Stuart  Russell,  Demis\\nHassabis, and Sam Altman, have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI.\\n\\n\\x0cIn May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to \"freely speak\\nout  about  the  risks  of AI\"  without  \"considering  how  this  impacts  Google.\"[259]  He  notably  mentioned\\nrisks  of  an AI  takeover,[260]  and  stressed  that  in  order  to  avoid  the  worst  outcomes,  establishing  safety\\nguidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI.[261]\\n\\nIn 2023, many leading AI experts issued the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI\\nshould be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\".[262]\\n\\nOther researchers, however, spoke in favor of a less dystopian view. AI pioneer Juergen Schmidhuber did\\nnot sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human\\nlives longer and healthier and easier.\"[263] While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can\\nalso  be  used  by  bad  actors,  \"they  can  also  be  used  against  the  bad  actors.\"[264][265]  Andrew  Ng  also\\nargued  that  \"it\\'s  a  mistake  to  fall  for  the  doomsday  hype  on AI—and  that  regulators  who  do  will  only\\nbenefit  vested  interests.\"[266]  Yann  LeCun  \"scoffs  at  his  peers\\'  dystopian  scenarios  of  supercharged\\nmisinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\"[267] In the early 2010s, experts argued that the\\nrisks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective\\nof a superintelligent machine.[268] However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible\\nsolutions became a serious area of research.[269]\\n\\nEthical machines and alignment\\n\\nFriendly AI  are  machines  that  have  been  designed  from  the  beginning  to  minimize  risks  and  to  make\\nchoices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI\\nshould be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI\\nbecomes an existential risk.[270]\\n\\nMachines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field\\nof  machine  ethics  provides  machines  with  ethical  principles  and  procedures  for  resolving  ethical\\ndilemmas.[271] The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,[271] and was founded at\\nan AAAI symposium in 2005.[272]\\n\\nOther  approaches  include  Wendell  Wallach\\'s  \"artificial  moral  agents\"[273]  and  Stuart  J.  Russell\\'s  three\\nprinciples for developing provably beneficial machines.[274]\\n\\nOpen source\\nActive  organizations  in  the  AI  open-source  community  include  Hugging  Face,[275]  Google,[276]\\nEleutherAI  and  Meta.[277] Various AI  models,  such  as  Llama  2,  Mistral  or  Stable  Diffusion,  have  been\\nmade  open-weight,[278][279]  meaning  that  their  architecture  and  trained  parameters  (the  \"weights\")  are\\npublicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned, which allows companies to specialize\\nthem with their own data and for their own use-case.[280] Open-weight models are useful for research and\\ninnovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as\\nobjecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn\\n\\n\\x0cthat  future AI  models  may  develop  dangerous  capabilities  (such  as  the  potential  to  drastically  facilitate\\nbioterrorism) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They\\nrecommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses.[281]\\n\\nFrameworks\\n\\nArtificial  Intelligence  projects  can  have  their  ethical  permissibility  tested  while  designing,  developing,\\nand implementing an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework containing the\\nSUM values—developed by the Alan Turing Institute tests projects in four main areas:[282][283]\\n\\nRespect the dignity of individual people\\nConnect with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively\\nCare for the wellbeing of everyone\\nProtect social values, justice, and the public interest\\n\\nOther developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference,\\nthe  Montreal  Declaration  for  Responsible AI,  and  the  IEEE\\'s  Ethics  of Autonomous  Systems  initiative,\\namong others;[284] however, these principles do not go without their criticisms, especially regards to the\\npeople chosen contributes to these frameworks.[285]\\n\\nPromotion  of  the  wellbeing  of  the  people  and  communities  that  these  technologies  affect  requires\\nconsideration  of  the  social  and  ethical  implications  at  all  stages  of AI  system  design,  development  and\\nimplementation,  and  collaboration  between  job  roles  such  as  data  scientists,  product  managers,  data\\nengineers, domain experts, and delivery managers.[286]\\n\\nThe  UK AI  Safety  Institute  released  in  2024  a  testing  toolset  called  \\'Inspect\\'  for AI  safety  evaluations\\navailable under a MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with\\nthird-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge,\\nability to reason, and autonomous capabilities.[287]\\n\\nRegulation\\n\\nThe  regulation  of  artificial  intelligence  is  the  development\\nof  public  sector  policies  and  laws  for  promoting  and\\nregulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation\\nof  algorithms.[288] The  regulatory  and  policy  landscape  for\\nAI  is  an  emerging  issue  in  jurisdictions  globally.[289]\\nAccording  to  AI  Index  at  Stanford,  the  annual  number  of\\nAI-related  laws  passed  in  the  127  survey  countries  jumped\\nfrom  one  passed \\nin  2022\\nalone.[290][291]  Between  2016  and  2020,  more  than  30\\ncountries adopted dedicated strategies for AI.[292] Most EU\\nmember  states  had  released  national  AI  strategies,  as  had\\nCanada,  China,  India,  Japan,  Mauritius, \\nthe  Russian\\nFederation,  Saudi Arabia,  United Arab  Emirates,  U.S.,  and\\nVietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia\\nand Tunisia.[292] The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a\\nneed  for AI  to  be  developed  in  accordance  with  human  rights  and  democratic  values,  to  ensure  public\\n\\nThe first global AI Safety Summit was held\\nin 2023 with a declaration calling for\\ninternational co-operation.\\n\\nto  37  passed \\n\\nin  2016 \\n\\n\\x0cconfidence  and  trust  in  the  technology.[292]  Henry  Kissinger,  Eric  Schmidt,  and  Daniel  Huttenlocher\\npublished a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI.[293]\\nIn 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they\\nbelieve  may  happen  in  less  than  10  years.[294]  In  2023,  the  United  Nations  also  launched  an  advisory\\nbody  to  provide  recommendations  on  AI  governance;  the  body  comprises  technology  company\\nexecutives,  governments  officials  and  academics.[295]  In  2024,  the  Council  of  Europe  created  the  first\\ninternational  legally  binding  treaty  on AI,  called  the  \"Framework  Convention  on Artificial  Intelligence\\nand Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law\". It was adopted by the European Union, the United\\nStates, the United Kingdom, and other signatories.[296]\\n\\nIn a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only\\n35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\".[290]\\nA 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to\\nhumanity.[297] In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional\\n41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding\\n\"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\".[298][299]\\n\\nIn November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the\\nnear and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks.[300]\\n28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start\\nof  the  summit,  calling  for  international  co-operation  to  manage  the  challenges  and  risks  of  artificial\\nintelligence.[301][302] In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit, 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety\\ncommitments on the development of AI.[303][304]\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nThe study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity.\\nThe study of logic led directly to Alan Turing\\'s theory of computation, which suggested that a machine,\\nby  shuffling  symbols  as  simple  as  \"0\"  and  \"1\",  could  simulate  any  conceivable  form  of  mathematical\\nreasoning.[305][306]  This,  along  with  concurrent  discoveries  in  cybernetics,  information  theory  and\\nneurobiology,  led  researchers  to  consider  the  possibility  of  building  an  \"electronic  brain\".[r]  They\\ndeveloped  several  areas  of  research  that  would  become  part  of AI,[308]  such  as  McCullouch  and  Pitts\\ndesign  for  \"artificial  neurons\"  in  1943,[115]  and  Turing\\'s  influential  1950  paper  \\'Computing  Machinery\\nand  Intelligence\\',  which  introduced  the  Turing  test  and  showed  that  \"machine  intelligence\"  was\\nplausible.[309][306]\\n\\nThe  field  of AI  research  was  founded  at  a  workshop  at  Dartmouth  College  in  1956.[s][6] The  attendees\\nbecame  the  leaders  of AI  research  in  the  1960s.[t]  They  and  their  students  produced  programs  that  the\\npress described as \"astonishing\":[u] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems\\nin  algebra,  proving  logical  theorems  and  speaking  English.[v][7] Artificial  intelligence  laboratories  were\\nset up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.[306]\\n\\nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in\\ncreating  a  machine  with  general  intelligence  and  considered  this  the  goal  of  their  field.[313]  In  1965\\nHerbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can\\ndo\".[314]  In  1967  Marvin  Minsky  agreed,  writing  that  \"within  a  generation  ...  the  problem  of  creating\\n\\n\\x0c\\'artificial intelligence\\' will substantially be solved\".[315] They had, however, underestimated the difficulty\\nof  the  problem.[w]  In  1974,  both  the  U.S.  and  British  governments  cut  off  exploratory  research  in\\nresponse to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill[317] and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress to fund\\nmore  productive  projects.[318]  Minsky\\'s  and  Papert\\'s  book  Perceptrons  was  understood  as  proving  that\\nartificial  neural  networks  would  never  be  useful  for  solving  real-world  tasks,  thus  discrediting  the\\napproach altogether.[319] The \"AI winter\", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult,\\nfollowed.[9]\\n\\nIn the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,[320] a form of\\nAI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for\\nAI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan\\'s fifth generation computer project inspired\\nthe U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research.[8] However, beginning with\\nthe collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-\\nlasting winter began.[10]\\n\\nUp  to  this  point,  most  of AI\\'s  funding  had  gone  to  projects  that  used  high-level  symbols  to  represent\\nmental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt\\nthat this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception,\\nrobotics,  learning  and  pattern  recognition,[321]  and  began  to  look  into  \"sub-symbolic\"  approaches.[322]\\nRodney Brooks rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that\\nmove and survive.[x] Judea Pearl, Lofti Zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and\\nuncertain  information  by  making  reasonable  guesses  rather  than  precise  logic.[86][327]  But  the  most\\nimportant  development  was  the  revival  of  \"connectionism\",  including  neural  network  research,  by\\nGeoffrey  Hinton  and  others.[328]  In  1990,  Yann  LeCun  successfully  showed  that  convolutional  neural\\nnetworks  can  recognize  handwritten  digits,  the  first  of  many  successful  applications  of  neural\\nnetworks.[329]\\n\\nAI  gradually  restored  its  reputation  in  the  late  1990s  and  early  21st  century  by  exploiting  formal\\nmathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This \"narrow\" and \"formal\"\\nfocus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics,\\neconomics  and  mathematics).[330]  By  2000,  solutions  developed  by AI  researchers  were  being  widely\\nused, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\" (a tendency known as\\nthe  AI  effect).[331]  However,  several  academic  researchers  became  concerned  that  AI  was  no  longer\\npursuing  its  original  goal  of  creating  versatile,  fully  intelligent  machines.  Beginning  around  2002,  they\\nfounded  the  subfield  of  artificial  general  intelligence  (or  \"AGI\"),  which  had  several  well-funded\\ninstitutions by the 2010s.[4]\\n\\nDeep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.[11]\\nFor  many  specific  tasks,  other  methods  were  abandoned.[y]  Deep  learning\\'s  success  was  based  on  both\\nhardware  improvements  (faster  computers,[333]  graphics  processing  units,  cloud  computing[334])  and\\naccess to large amounts of data[335] (including curated datasets,[334] such as ImageNet). Deep learning\\'s\\nsuccess  led  to  an  enormous  increase  in  interest  and  funding  in AI.[z]  The  amount  of  machine  learning\\nresearch (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019.[292]\\n\\nIn  2016,  issues  of  fairness  and  the  misuse  of  technology  were  catapulted  into  center  stage  at  machine\\nlearning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-\\nfocussed  their  careers  on  these  issues.  The  alignment  problem  became  a  serious  field  of  academic\\n\\n\\x0cstudy.[269]\\n\\nIn  the  late  teens  and  early  2020s,  AGI  companies  began  to  deliver  programs  that  created  enormous\\ninterest. In 2015, AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the world champion Go player. The program\\nwas taught only the rules of the game and developed strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model\\nthat  was  released  in  2020  by  OpenAI  and  is  capable  of  generating  high-quality  human-like  text.[336]\\nThese  programs,  and  others,  inspired  an  aggressive AI  boom,  where  large  companies  began  investing\\nbillions in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about $50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around\\n2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized\\nin \"AI\".[337] About 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022.[338]\\n\\nPhilosophy\\n\\nPhilosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make\\nintelligent  machines.[339]  Another  major  focus  has  been  whether  machines  can  be  conscious,  and  the\\nassociated  ethical  implications.[340]  Many  other  topics  in  philosophy  are  relevant  to  AI,  such  as\\nepistemology  and  free  will.[341]  Rapid  advancements  have  intensified  public  discussions  on  the\\nphilosophy and ethics of AI.[340]\\n\\nDefining artificial intelligence\\nAlan  Turing  wrote  in  1950  \"I  propose  to  consider  the  question  \\'can  machines  think\\'?\"[342]  He  advised\\nchanging the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to\\nshow intelligent behaviour\".[342] He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to\\nsimulate  human  conversation.[309]  Since  we  can  only  observe  the  behavior  of  the  machine,  it  does  not\\nmatter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these\\nthings about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.\"[343]\\n\\nRussell  and  Norvig  agree  with  Turing  that  intelligence  must  be\\ndefined  in  terms  of  external  behavior,  not  internal  structure.[1]\\nHowever,  they  are  critical  that  the  test  requires  the  machine  to\\nimitate humans. \"Aeronautical engineering texts,\" they wrote, \"do\\nnot  define  the  goal  of  their  field  as  making  \\'machines  that  fly  so\\nexactly  like  pigeons  that  they  can  fool  other  pigeons.\\' \"[345]  AI\\nfounder \\nthat  \"Artificial\\nintelligence \\nis  not,  by  definition,  simulation  of  human\\nintelligence\".[346]\\n\\nJohn  McCarthy  agreed,  writing \\n\\nMcCarthy  defines  intelligence  as  \"the  computational  part  of  the\\nability  to  achieve  goals  in  the  world\".[347]  Another  AI  founder,\\nMarvin Minsky similarly describes it as \"the ability to solve hard\\nproblems\".[348] The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of\\nagents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined\\ngoals.[1]  These  definitions  view  intelligence  in  terms  of  well-defined  problems  with  well-defined\\n\\nThe Turing test can provide some\\nevidence of intelligence, but it\\npenalizes non-human intelligent\\nbehavior.[344]\\n\\n\\x0csolutions,  where  both  the  difficulty  of  the  problem  and  the  performance  of  the  program  are  direct\\nmeasures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may\\nnot even be possible.\\n\\nAnother definition has been adopted by Google,[349] a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition\\nstipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to\\nthe way it is defined in biological intelligence.\\n\\nSome authors have suggested in practice, that the definition of AI is vague and difficult to define, with\\ncontention  as  to  whether  classical  algorithms  should  be  categorised  as  AI,[350]  with  many  companies\\nduring  the  early  2020s AI  boom  using  the  term  as  a  marketing  buzzword,  often  even  if  they  did  \"not\\nactually use AI in a material way\".[351]\\n\\nEvaluating approaches to AI\\nNo  established  unifying  theory  or  paradigm  has  guided  AI  research  for  most  of  its  history.[aa]  The\\nunprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much\\nso  that  some  sources,  especially  in  the  business  world,  use  the  term  \"artificial  intelligence\"  to  mean\\n\"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow. Critics\\nargue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.\\n\\nSymbolic AI and its limits\\nSymbolic AI (or \"GOFAI\")[353] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they\\nsolve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\"\\ntasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems\\nhypothesis:  \"A  physical  symbol  system  has  the  necessary  and  sufficient  means  of  general  intelligent\\naction.\"[354]\\n\\nHowever,  the  symbolic  approach  failed  on  many  tasks  that  humans  solve  easily,  such  as  learning,\\nrecognizing  an  object  or  commonsense  reasoning.  Moravec\\'s  paradox  is  the  discovery  that  high-level\\n\"intelligent\"  tasks  were  easy  for  AI,  but  low  level  \"instinctive\"  tasks  were  extremely  difficult.[355]\\nPhilosopher  Hubert  Dreyfus  had  argued  since  the  1960s  that  human  expertise  depends  on  unconscious\\ninstinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than\\nexplicit  symbolic  knowledge.[356]  Although  his  arguments  had  been  ridiculed  and  ignored  when  they\\nwere first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.[ab][16]\\n\\nThe issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that\\nhuman intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research\\ninto  symbolic  AI  will  still  be  necessary  to  attain  general  intelligence,[358][359]  in  part  because  sub-\\nsymbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a\\nmodern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial\\nintelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches.\\n\\nNeat vs. scruffy\\n\\n\\x0c\"Neats\"  hope  that  intelligent  behavior  is  described  using  simple,  elegant  principles  (such  as  logic,\\noptimization, or neural networks). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of\\nunrelated  problems.  Neats  defend  their  programs  with  theoretical  rigor,  scruffies  rely  mainly  on\\nincremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s,[360] but\\neventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both.\\n\\nSoft vs. hard computing\\nFinding  a  provably  correct  or  optimal  solution  is  intractable  for  many  important  problems.[15]  Soft\\ncomputing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are\\ntolerant  of  imprecision,  uncertainty,  partial  truth  and  approximation.  Soft  computing  was  introduced  in\\nthe late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with\\nneural networks.\\n\\nNarrow vs. general AI\\n\\nAI  researchers  are  divided  as  to  whether  to  pursue  the  goals  of  artificial  general  intelligence  and\\nsuperintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these\\nsolutions  will  lead  indirectly  to  the  field\\'s  long-term  goals.[361][362]  General  intelligence  is  difficult  to\\ndefine and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific\\nproblems  with  specific  solutions.  The  sub-field  of  artificial  general  intelligence  studies  this  area\\nexclusively.\\n\\nMachine consciousness, sentience, and mind\\n\\nThe philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental\\nstates,  in  the  same  sense  that  human  beings  do.  This  issue  considers  the  internal  experiences  of  the\\nmachine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because\\nit  does  not  affect  the  goals  of  the  field:  to  build  machines  that  can  solve  problems  using  intelligence.\\nRussell and Norvig add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way\\nhumans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\"[363] However, the question has become central to\\nthe philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction.\\n\\nConsciousness\\n\\nDavid  Chalmers  identified  two  problems  in  understanding  the  mind,  which  he  named  the  \"hard\"  and\\n\"easy\"  problems  of  consciousness.[364]  The  easy  problem  is  understanding  how  the  brain  processes\\nsignals,  makes  plans  and  controls  behavior.  The  hard  problem  is  explaining  how  this  feels  or  why  it\\nshould feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something\\n(Dennett\\'s consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human information processing is easy\\nto explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-\\nblind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear\\nwhat would be required for the person to know what red looks like.[365]\\n\\nComputationalism and functionalism\\n\\n\\x0cComputationalism  is  the  position  in  the  philosophy  of  mind  that  the  human  mind  is  an  information\\nprocessing  system  and  that  thinking  is  a  form  of  computing.  Computationalism  argues  that  the\\nrelationship  between  mind  and  body  is  similar  or  identical  to  the  relationship  between  software  and\\nhardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem. This philosophical position was inspired\\nby  the  work  of  AI  researchers  and  cognitive  scientists  in  the  1960s  and  was  originally  proposed  by\\nphilosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.[366]\\n\\nPhilosopher  John  Searle  characterized  this  position  as  \"strong  AI\":  \"The  appropriately  programmed\\ncomputer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human\\nbeings have minds.\"[ac] Searle counters this assertion with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to\\nshow that, even if a machine perfectly simulates human behavior, there is still no reason to suppose it also\\nhas a mind.[370]\\n\\nAI welfare and rights\\n\\nIt is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel),\\nand if so, to what degree.[371] But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer,\\nthen  it  may  be  entitled  to  certain  rights  or  welfare  protection  measures,  similarly  to  animals.[372][373]\\nSapience  (a  set  of  capacities  related  to  high  intelligence,  such  as  discernment  or  self-awareness)  may\\nprovide  another  moral  basis  for AI  rights.[372]  Robot  rights  are  also  sometimes  proposed  as  a  practical\\nway to integrate autonomous agents into society.[374]\\n\\nIn 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI\\nsystems.  Similarly  to  the  legal  status  of  companies,  it  would  have  conferred  rights  but  also\\nresponsibilities.[375]  Critics  argued  in  2018  that  granting  rights  to  AI  systems  would  downplay  the\\nimportance  of  human  rights,  and  that  legislation  should  focus  on  user  needs  rather  than  speculative\\nfuturistic  scenarios.  They  also  noted  that  robots  lacked  the  autonomy  to  take  part  to  society  on  their\\nown.[376][377]\\n\\nProgress  in AI  increased  interest  in  the  topic.  Proponents  of AI  welfare  and  rights  often  argue  that AI\\nsentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot\\nanalogous to slavery or factory farming, which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created\\nand carelessly exploited.[373][372]\\n\\nFuture\\n\\nSuperintelligence and the singularity\\n\\nA  superintelligence  is  a  hypothetical  agent  that  would  possess  intelligence  far  surpassing  that  of  the\\nbrightest  and  most  gifted  human  mind.[362]If  research  into  artificial  general  intelligence  produced\\nsufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software\\nwould be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an \"intelligence explosion\" and\\nVernor Vinge called a \"singularity\".[378]\\n\\n\\x0cHowever,  technologies  cannot  improve  exponentially  indefinitely,  and  typically  follow  an  S-shaped\\ncurve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.[379]\\n\\nTranshumanism\\n\\nRobot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted\\nthat humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than\\neither.  This  idea,  called  transhumanism,  has  roots  in  the  writings  of  Aldous  Huxley  and  Robert\\nEttinger.[380]\\n\\nEdward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution\", an idea first proposed by\\nSamuel  Butler\\'s  \"Darwin  among  the  Machines\"  as  far  back  as  1863,  and  expanded  upon  by  George\\nDyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence.[381]\\n\\nIn fiction\\n\\nThought-capable  artificial  beings  have  appeared  as\\nstorytelling  devices  since  antiquity,[382]  and  have  been  a\\npersistent theme in science fiction.[383]\\n\\nA common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley\\'s\\nFrankenstein,  where  a  human  creation  becomes  a  threat  to\\nits masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke\\'s\\nand Stanley Kubrick\\'s 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968),\\nwith  HAL  9000,  the  murderous  computer  in  charge  of  the\\nDiscovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984)\\nand  The  Matrix  (1999).  In  contrast,  the  rare  loyal  robots\\nsuch as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and\\nBishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.[384]\\n\\nThe word \"robot\" itself was coined by Karel\\nČapek in his 1921 play R.U.R., the title\\nstanding for \"Rossum\\'s Universal Robots\".\\n\\nIsaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the \"Multivac\"\\nsuper-intelligent  computer.  Asimov\\'s  laws  are  often  brought  up  during  lay  discussions  of  machine\\nethics;[385]  while  almost  all  artificial  intelligence  researchers  are  familiar  with  Asimov\\'s  laws  through\\npopular  culture,  they  generally  consider  the  laws  useless  for  many  reasons,  one  of  which  is  their\\nambiguity.[386]\\n\\nSeveral works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing\\nus artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek\\'s R.U.R.,\\nthe films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric\\nSheep?, by Philip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered\\nby technology created with artificial intelligence.[387]\\n\\nSee also\\n\\nArtificial general intelligence\\n\\n\\x0cArtificial intelligence content detection – Software to detect AI-generated content\\nBehavior selection algorithm – Algorithm that selects actions for intelligent agents\\nBusiness process automation – Automation of business processes\\nCase-based reasoning – Process of solving new problems based on the solutions of similar\\npast problems\\nComputational intelligence – Ability of a computer to learn a specific task from data or\\nexperimental observation\\nDigital immortality – Hypothetical concept of storing a personality in digital form\\nEmergent algorithm – Algorithm exhibiting emergent behavior\\nFemale gendering of AI technologies – Gender biases in digital technology\\nGlossary of artificial intelligence – List of definitions of terms and concepts commonly used\\nin the study of artificial intelligence\\nIntelligence amplification – Use of information technology to augment human intelligence\\nMind uploading – Hypothetical process of digitally emulating a brain\\nMoravec\\'s paradox – Observation that perception requires more computation than\\nreasoning\\nOrganoid intelligence – Use of brain cells and brain organoids for intelligent computing\\nRobotic process automation – Form of business process automation technology\\nWeak artificial intelligence – Form of artificial intelligence\\nWetware computer – Computer composed of organic material\\nHallucination (artificial intelligence) – Erroneous material generated by AI\\n\\nExplanatory notes\\n\\na.

It is among the reasons that expert systems proved to be inefficient for capturing\\n\\nknowledge.[30][31]\\n\\nd. \"Rational agent\" is general term used in economics, philosophy and theoretical artificial\\n\\nintelligence. It can refer to anything that directs its behavior to accomplish goals, such as a\\nperson, an animal, a corporation, a nation, or in the case of AI, a computer program.\\ne. Alan Turing discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper\\n\\n\"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\".[42] In 1956, at the original Dartmouth AI summer\\nconference, Ray Solomonoff wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning:\\n\"An Inductive Inference Machine\".[43]\\n\\nf. See AI winter § Machine translation and the ALPAC report of 1966\\ng. Compared with symbolic logic, formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive. For\\n\\ninference to be tractable, most observations must be conditionally independent of one\\nanother. AdSense uses a Bayesian network with over 300 million edges to learn which ads\\nto serve.[93]\\n\\nh. Expectation–maximization, one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning, allows\\n\\nclustering in the presence of unknown latent variables.[95]\\n\\n\\x0ci. Some form of deep neural networks (without a specific learning algorithm) were described\\n\\nby: Warren S. McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943)[115] Alan Turing (1948);[116] Karl Steinbuch\\nand Roger David Joseph (1961).[117] Deep or recurrent networks that learned (or used\\ngradient descent) were developed by: Frank Rosenblatt(1957);[116] Oliver Selfridge\\n(1959);[117] Alexey Ivakhnenko and Valentin Lapa (1965);[118] Kaoru Nakano (1971);[119]\\nShun-Ichi Amari (1972);[119] John Joseph Hopfield (1982).[119] Precursors to\\nbackpropagation were developed by: Henry J. Kelley (1960);[116] Arthur E. Bryson\\n(1962);[116] Stuart Dreyfus (1962);[116] Arthur E. Bryson and Yu-Chi Ho (1969);[116]\\nBackpropagation was independently developed by: Seppo Linnainmaa (1970);[120] Paul\\nWerbos (1974).[116]\\n\\nj. Geoffrey Hinton said, of his work on neural networks in the 1990s, \"our labeled datasets\\n\\nwere thousands of times too small. [And] our computers were millions of times too slow.\"[121]\\n\\nk. In statistics, a bias is a systematic error or deviation from the correct value. But in the\\n\\ncontext of fairness, it refers to a tendency in favor or against a certain group or individual\\ncharacteristic, usually in a way that is considered unfair or harmful. A statistically unbiased\\nAI system that produces disparate outcomes for different demographic groups may thus be\\nviewed as biased in the ethical sense.[205]\\n\\nl.

Russell and Norvig write: \"in almost all cases, these early systems failed on more difficult\\n\\nproblems\"[316]\\n\\nx. Embodied approaches to AI[323] were championed by Hans Moravec[324] and Rodney\\nBrooks[325] and went by many names: Nouvelle AI.[325] Developmental robotics.[326]\\n\\ny. Matteo Wong wrote in The Atlantic: \"Whereas for decades, computer-science fields such as\\n\\nnatural-language processing, computer vision, and robotics used extremely different\\nmethods, now they all use a programming method called \"deep learning.\" As a result, their\\ncode and approaches have become more similar, and their models are easier to integrate\\ninto one another.\"[332]\\n\\n\\x0cz. Jack Clark wrote in Bloomberg: \"After a half-decade of quiet breakthroughs in artificial\\n\\nintelligence, 2015 has been a landmark year.

       "'Artificial intelligence  Artificial  intelligence   AI    in  its  broadest  sense   is  intelligence  exhibited  by  machines   particularly computer  systems   It  is  a  field  of  research  in  computer  science  that  develops  and  studies  methods  and software  that  enable  machines  to  perceive  their  environment  and  use  learning  and  intelligence  to  take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals     Such machines may be called AIs   Some  high profile  applications  of  AI  include  advanced  web  search  engines   e g    Google  Search   recommendation systems  used by YouTube  Amazon  and Netflix   interacting via human speech  e g   Google  Assistant   Siri   and  Alexa    autonomous  vehicles   e g    Waymo    generative  and  creative  tools  e g    ChatGPT   and AI  art    and  superhuman  play  and  analysis  in  strategy  games   e g    chess  and  Go   However  many AI applications are not perceived as AI   A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications  often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it s not labeled AI anymore          The various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools  The  traditional  goals  of  AI  research  include  reasoning   knowledge  representation   planning   learning  natural language processing  perception  and support for robotics  a  General intelligence the ability to complete  any  task  performable  by  a  human  on  an  at  least  equal  level is  among  the  field s  long term goals      To  reach  these  goals  AI  researchers  have  adapted  and  integrated  a  wide  range  of  techniques  including  search  and  mathematical  optimization   formal  logic   artificial  neural  networks   and  methods based  on  statistics   operations  research   and  economics  b  AI  also  draws  upon  psychology   linguistics  philosophy  neuroscience  and other fields      Artificial  intelligence  was  founded  as  an  academic  discipline  in            and  the  field  went  through multiple cycles of optimism        followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding  known as AI  winter          Funding  and  interest  vastly  increased  after        when  deep  learning  outperformed previous  AI  techniques       This  growth  accelerated  further  after        with  the  transformer architecture      and by the early     s hundreds of billions of dollars were being invested in AI  known as  the   AI  boom     The  widespread  use  of  AI  in  the    st  century  exposed  several  unintended consequences  and  harms  in  the  present  and  raised  concerns  about  its  risks  and  long term  effects  in  the future   prompting  discussions  about  regulatory  policies  to  ensure  the  safety  and  benefits  of  the technology   Goals  The  general  problem  of  simulating   or  creating   intelligence  has  been  broken  into  subproblems   These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display  The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research  a   Reasoning and problem solving   Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step by step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions      By the late     s and     s  methods were developed for information   employing  concepts  from  probability  and dealing  with  uncertain  or  economics       incomplete   Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a  combinatorial  explosion    They  become  exponentially  slower  as  the  problems  grow       Even  humans rarely  use  the  step by step  deduction  that  early  AI  research  could  model   They  solve  most  of  their problems using fast  intuitive judgments      Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem   Knowledge representation Knowledge  representation  and  knowledge  engineering     allow  AI  programs  to  answer  questions  intelligently  and make deductions about real world facts  Formal knowledge representations  are  used  in  content based  indexing  and retrieval       scene  interpretation       clinical  decision support       knowledge  discovery   mining   interesting   and actionable  inferences  from  large  databases        and  other areas       A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program  An ontology is the set of  objects   relations   concepts   and  properties  used  by  a particular domain of knowledge      Knowledge bases need to  represent  things  such  as  objects   properties   categories  and  relations  between  objects       situations   events   states  and  time       causes  and  effects       knowledge  about knowledge   what  we  know  about  what  other  people know       default reasoning  things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing       and many other aspects and domains of knowledge   An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts   Among  the  most  difficult  problems  in  knowledge  representation  are  the  breadth  of  commonsense knowledge  the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous       and the sub symbolic form  of  most  commonsense  knowledge   much  of  what  people  know  is  not  represented  as   facts   or  statements  that they could express verbally       There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition  the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications  c   Planning and decision making  An   agent   is  anything  that  perceives  and  takes  actions  in  the  world   A  rational  agent  has  goals  or preferences and takes actions to make them happen  d      In automated planning  the agent has a specific goal       In  automated  decision making   the  agent  has  preferences there  are  some  situations  it  would prefer to be in  and some situations it is trying to avoid  The decision making agent assigns a number to each situation  called the  utility   that measures how much the agent prefers it  For each possible action    it can calculate the  expected utility   the utility of all possible outcomes of the action  weighted by the probability  that  the  outcome  will  occur   It  can  then  choose  the  action  with  the  maximum  expected utility       In classical planning  the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be      In most real world problems   however   the  agent  may  not  be  certain  about  the  situation  they  are  in   it  is   unknown   or  unobservable    and  it  may  not  know  for  certain  what  will  happen  after  each  possible  action   it  is  not  deterministic    It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked       In  some  problems   the  agent s  preferences  may  be  uncertain   especially  if  there  are  other  agents  or humans involved  These can be learned  e g   with inverse reinforcement learning   or the agent can seek information  to  improve  its  preferences       Information  value  theory  can  be  used  to  weigh  the  value  of exploratory  or  experimental  actions       The  space  of  possible  future  actions  and  situations  is  typically intractably large  so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be   A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the  cost  of  each  action   A  policy  associates  a  decision  with  each  possible  state   The  policy  could  be calculated  e g   by iteration   be heuristic  or it can be learned       Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents       Learning  Machine  learning  is  the  study  of  programs  that  can  improve  their  performance  on  a  given  task automatically      It has been a part of AI from the beginning  e   There are several kinds of machine learning  Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance      Supervised learning requires a human to label the input data first  and comes in two main varieties  classification  where the program must learn to predict  what  category  the  input  belongs  in   and  regression   where  the  program  must  deduce  a  numeric function based on numeric input        In reinforcement learning  the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones  The agent learns  to  choose  responses  that  are  classified  as   good        Transfer  learning  is  when  the  knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem      Deep learning is a type of machine learning that  runs  inputs  through  biologically  inspired  artificial  neural  networks  for  all  of  these  types  of learning       Computational  learning  theory  can  assess  learners  by  computational  complexity   by  sample  complexity  how much data is required   or by other notions of optimization       Natural language processing   Natural  language  processing   NLP       allows  programs  to  read   write  and  communicate  in  human languages  such  as  English   Specific  problems  include  speech  recognition   speech  synthesis   machine translation  information extraction  information retrieval and question answering       Early work  based on Noam Chomsky s generative grammar and semantic networks  had difficulty with word sense  disambiguation f   unless  restricted  to  small  domains  called   micro worlds    due  to  the common  sense  knowledge  problem        Margaret  Masterman  believed  that  it  was  meaning  and  not grammar that was the key to understanding languages  and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure   Modern  deep  learning  techniques  for  NLP  include  word  embedding   representing  words   typically  as vectors  encoding  their  meaning        transformers   a  deep  learning  architecture  using  an  attention mechanism       and others      In       generative pre trained transformer  or  GPT   language models began to generate coherent text          and by       these models were able to get human level scores on the bar exam  SAT test  GRE test  and many other real world applications       Perception  Machine  perception  is  the  ability  to  use  input  from  sensors   such  as  cameras   microphones   wireless signals  active lidar  sonar  radar  and tactile sensors  to deduce aspects of the world  Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input       includes  speech  recognition       The  field  recognition     object tracking      and robotic perception       image  classification       facial  recognition   object  Social intelligence  is  an   interdisciplinary  umbrella   Affective  computing  that comprises  systems  that  recognize   interpret   process   or  simulate human feeling  emotion  and mood      For example  some virtual assistants  are  programmed  to  speak  conversationally  or  even  to banter  humorously   it  makes  them  appear  more  sensitive  to  the emotional  dynamics  of  human  interaction   or  to  otherwise facilitate human computer interaction   However  this tends to give na ve users an unrealistic conception of  the  intelligence  of  existing  computer  agents       Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis  and   more  recently   multimodal  sentiment  analysis  wherein  AI  classifies  the  affects  displayed  by  a  videotaped subject       Kismet  a robot head which was made in the     s  it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions       General intelligence   A  machine  with  artificial  general  intelligence  should  be  able  to  solve  a  wide  variety  of  problems  with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence      Techniques  AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above  b   Search and optimization AI  can  solve  many  problems  by  intelligently  searching  through  many  possible  solutions       There  are two very different kinds of search used in AI  state space search and local search   State space search State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state      For example  planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals  attempting to find a path to a target goal  a process called means ends analysis       Simple exhaustive searches     are rarely sufficient for most real world problems  the search space  the number of places to search  quickly grows to astronomical numbers  The result is a search that is too slow or never completes       Heuristics  or  rules of thumb  can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal       Adversarial search is used for game playing programs  such as chess or Go  It searches through a tree of possible moves and counter moves  looking for a winning position       Local search  Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem   It  begins  with  some  form  of  guess  and  refines  it incrementally       Gradient  descent  is  a  type  of  local  search  that  optimizes  a  set  of numerical  parameters  by  to minimize  a  loss  function   Variants  of  gradient  descent  are commonly used to train neural networks       incrementally  adjusting   them   Another  type  of  local  search  is  evolutionary  computation   which aims  to  iteratively  improve  a  set  of  candidate  solutions  by  mutating   and   recombining   them   selecting  only  the  fittest  to survive each generation       Illustration of gradient descent for   different starting points  two parameters  represented by the plan coordinates  are adjusted in order to minimize the loss function  the height    Distributed  search  processes  can  coordinate  via  swarm  intelligence  algorithms   Two  popular  swarm algorithms  used  in  search  are  particle  swarm  optimization   inspired  by  bird  flocking   and  ant  colony optimization  inspired by ant trails        Logic Formal  logic  is  used  for  reasoning  and  knowledge  representation       Formal  logic  comes  in  two  main forms   propositional  logic   which  operates  on  statements  that  are  true  or  false  and  uses  logical connectives  such  as   and     or     not   and   implies        and  predicate  logic   which  also  operates  on objects  predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as  Every X is a Y  and  There are some Xs that are Ys         Deductive  reasoning  in  logic  is  the  process  of  proving  a  new  statement   conclusion   from  other statements  that  are  given  and  assumed  to  be  true   the  premises        Proofs  can  be  structured  as  proof trees   in  which  nodes  are  labelled  by  sentences   and  children  nodes  are  connected  to  parent  nodes  by inference rules   Given a problem and a set of premises  problem solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms  In the  case  of  Horn  clauses   problem solving  search  can  be  performed  by  reasoning  forwards  from  the premises or backwards from the problem      In the more general case of the clausal form of first order logic   resolution  is  a  single   axiom free  rule  of  inference   in  which  a  problem  is  solved  by  proving  a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved       Inference  in  both  Horn  clause  logic  and  first order  logic  is  undecidable   and  therefore  intractable  However   backward  reasoning  with  Horn  clauses   which  underpins  computation  in  the  logic programming  language  Prolog   is  Turing  complete   Moreover   its  efficiency  is  competitive  with computation in other symbolic programming languages       Fuzzy  logic  assigns  a   degree  of  truth   between     and      It  can  therefore  handle  propositions  that  are vague and partially true       Non monotonic  logics   including  logic  programming  with  negation  as  failure   are  designed  to  handle default reasoning      Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains   Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning  Many  problems  in AI   including  in  reasoning   planning   learning   perception   and  robotics   require  the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information  AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics      Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan  using decision theory  decision  analysis       and  information  value  theory       These  tools  include  models  such  as  Markov decision processes      dynamic decision networks      game theory and mechanism design       Bayesian  networks      are  a  tool  that  can  be  used  for  reasoning   using  the  Bayesian  inference algorithm   g      learning  using the expectation maximization algorithm   h      planning  using decision networks      and perception  using dynamic Bayesian networks         Probabilistic  algorithms  can  also  be  used for  filtering   prediction   smoothing   and finding  explanations  for  streams  of  data  thus  helping  perception  systems  analyze processes that occur over time  e g   hidden Markov models or Kalman filters        Classifiers and statistical learning methods  A simple Bayesian network  with the associated conditional probability tables  The  simplest  AI  applications  can  be divided into two types  classifiers  e g    if shiny  then  diamond     on  one  hand   and controllers   e g     if  diamond  then  pick up    on the other hand  Classifiers     are functions that use pattern  matching  to  determine  the  closest  match   They  can be  fine tuned  based  on  chosen  examples  using  supervised learning   Each  pattern   also  called  an   observation    is labeled with a certain predefined class  All the observations combined  with  their  class  labels  are  known  as  a  data  set  When  a  new  observation  is  received   that  observation  is classified based on previous experience       There are many kinds of classifiers in use      The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning  algorithm        K nearest  neighbor  algorithm  was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid     s  and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine  SVM  displaced  k nearest  neighbor  in  the      s        The  naive Bayes  classifier  is  reportedly  the   most  widely  used learner        at  Google   due  in  part  to  its  scalability       Neural networks are also used as classifiers        Expectation maximization clustering of Old Faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption   Artificial neural networks  An  artificial  neural  network  is  based  on  a  collection  of  nodes  also  known  as  artificial  neurons   which loosely  model  the  neurons  in  a  biological  brain   It  is  trained  to  recognise  patterns   once  trained   it  can recognise those patterns in fresh data  There is an input  at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output  Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold  the data is transmitted to the next layer  A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least   hidden layers        Learning  algorithms  for  neural  networks  use  local  search  to  choose  the  weights  that  will  get  the  right output  for  each  input  during  training   The  most  common  training  technique  is  the  backpropagation algorithm        Neural  networks  learn  to  model  complex  relationships  between  inputs  and  outputs  and find patterns in data  In theory  a neural network can learn any function         In  feedforward  neural  networks  the  signal  passes  in  only  one direction        Recurrent  neural  networks  feed  the  output  signal back into the input  which allows short term memories of previous input  events   Long  short  term  memory  is  the  most  successful network  architecture  for  recurrent  networks        Perceptrons      use only a single layer of neurons  deep learning      uses multiple layers   Convolutional  neural  networks  strengthen  the  connection between neurons that are  close  to each other this is especially important in image processing  where a local set of neurons must identify an  edge  before the network can identify an object        A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes  akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain   Deep learning Deep  learning       uses  several  layers  of  neurons  between  the  network s inputs  and  outputs  The  multiple  layers  can  progressively  extract  higher  level features from the raw input  For example  in image processing  lower layers may identify edges  while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits  letters  or faces        speech   recognition   natural   language  processing    Deep  learning  has  profoundly  improved  the  performance  of  programs  in many  important  subfields  of  artificial  intelligence   including  computer vision   image classification        and  others  The  reason  that  deep  learning  performs  so well in so many applications is not known as of            The sudden success of deep learning in            did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough  deep neural networks and backpropagation  had  been  described  by  many  people   as  far  back  as  the      s  i   but  because  of  two factors   the  incredible  increase  in  computer  power   including  the  hundred fold  increase  in  speed  by switching  to  GPUs   and  the  availability  of  vast  amounts  of  training  data   especially  the  giant  curated datasets used for benchmark testing  such as ImageNet  j   GPT  Generative pre trained transformers  GPT  are large language models  LLMs  that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences  Text based GPT models are pretrained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet  The pretraining consists of predicting the next token  a token being  usually  a  word   subword   or  punctuation    Throughout  this  pretraining   GPT  models  accumulate knowledge  about  the  world  and  can  then  generate  human like  text  by  repeatedly  predicting  the  next token   Typically   a  subsequent  training  phase  makes  the  model  more  truthful   useful   and  harmless  usually  with  a  technique  called  reinforcement  learning  from  human  feedback   RLHF    Current  GPT models  are  prone  to  generating  falsehoods  called   hallucinations    although  this  can  be  reduced  with RLHF and quality data  They are used in chatbots  which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text              Current  models  and  services  include  Gemini   formerly  Bard    ChatGPT   Grok   Claude   Copilot   and LLaMA        Multimodal  GPT  models  can  process  different  types  of  data   modalities   such  as  images  videos  sound  and text        Hardware and software  In  the  late      s   graphics  processing  units   GPUs   that  were  increasingly  designed  with  AI specific enhancements  and  used  with  specialized  TensorFlow  software  had  replaced  previously  used  central processing  unit   CPUs   as  the  dominant  means  for  large scale   commercial  and  academic   machine learning models  training       Specialized programming languages such as Prolog were used in early AI research       but general purpose programming languages like Python have become predominant        The  transistor  density  in  integrated  circuits  has  been  observed  to  roughly  double  every      months a trend  known  as  Moore s  law   named  after  the  Intel  co founder  Gordon  Moore   who  first  identified  it  Improvements in GPUs have been even faster        Applications  AI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the     s  including  search  engines   such  as  Google  Search    targeting  online  advertisements   recommendation  systems  offered  by  Netflix   YouTube  or  Amazon    driving  internet  traffic   targeted

quality  of  life        Through  the  lens  of  the  Hippocratic  Oath   medical  professionals  are  ethically compelled to use AI  if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients             For medical research  AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data  This is particularly important  for  organoid  and  tissue  engineering  development  which  use  microscopy  imaging  as  a  key technique  in  fabrication        It  has  been  suggested  that  AI  can  overcome  discrepancies  in  funding allocated to different fields of research       New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant  pathways   For  example  AlphaFold             demonstrated  the  ability  to  approximate   in  hours rather  than  months   the   D  structure  of  a  protein        In         it  was  reported  that  AI guided  drug discovery  helped  find  a  class  of  antibiotics  capable  of  killing  two  different  types  of  drug resistant bacteria       In       researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson s disease   drug treatments  Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping  or aggregation  of alpha  synuclein   the  protein  that  characterises  Parkinson s  disease    They  were  able  to  speed  up  the  initial screening process ten fold and reduce the cost by a thousand fold             Games  Game  playing  programs  have  been  used  since  the      s  to  demonstrate  and  test  AI s  most  advanced techniques       Deep Blue became the first computer chess playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion   Garry Kasparov  on    May            In       in a  Jeopardy   quiz show exhibition match  IBM s question answering system  Watson  defeated the two greatest Jeopardy  champions  Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings  by a significant margin       In March       AlphaGo won   out of   games of Go in a match  with  Go  champion  Lee  Sedol   becoming  the  first  computer  Go playing  system  to  beat  a professional Go player without handicaps  Then  in       it defeated Ke Jie  who was the best Go player in  the  world        Other  programs  handle  imperfect information  games   such  as  the  poker playing program  Pluribus        DeepMind  developed  increasingly  generalistic  reinforcement  learning  models  such as with MuZero  which could be trained to play chess  Go  or Atari games       In       DeepMind s AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II  a particularly challenging real time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map       In       an AI agent competed in a PlayStation  Gran  Turismo  competition   winning  against  four  of  the  world s  best  Gran  Turismo  drivers using  deep  reinforcement  learning        In         Google  DeepMind  introduced  SIMA   a  type  of  AI capable  of  autonomously  playing  nine  previously  unseen  open world  video  games  by  observing  screen output  as well as executing short  specific tasks in response to natural language instructions        Mathematics  In mathematics  special forms of formal step by step reasoning are used  In contrast  LLMs such as GPT    Turbo  Gemini Ultra  Claude Opus  LLaMa   or Mistral Large are working with probabilistic models  which  can  produce  wrong  answers  in  the  form  of  hallucinations  Therefore   they  need  not  only  a  large database  of  mathematical  problems  to  learn  from  but  also  methods  such  as  supervised  fine tuning  or trained  classifiers  with  human annotated  data  to  improve  answers  for  new  problems  and  learn  from corrections        A        study  showed  that  the  performance  of  some  language  models  for  reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low  even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data        Alternatively   dedicated  models  for  mathematic  problem  solving  with  higher  precision  for  the  outcome including  proof  of  theorems  have  been  developed  such  as  Alpha  Tensor   Alpha  Geometry  and  Alpha Proof all

of this technology        Generative AI  In the early     s  generative AI gained widespread prominence  GenAI  is AI  capable  of  generating  text   images   videos   or  other data  using  generative  models             often  in  response  to prompts             In March           of U S  adults had heard about ChatGPT and      had  tried  it        The  increasing  realism  and  ease of use  of AI based  text to image  generators  such  as  Midjourney   DALL E  and Stable Diffusion sparked a trend of viral AI generated photos  Widespread attention was gained by a fake photo of Pope Francis wearing a white puffer coat  the fictional arrest of Donald Trump  and  a  hoax  of  an  attack  on  the  Pentagon   as  well  as  the  usage  in professional creative arts             Vincent van Gogh in watercolour created by generative AI software  Agents  Artificial  intelligent   AI   agents  are  software  entities  designed  to  perceive  their  environment   make decisions  and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals  These agents can interact with users  their environment  or other agents  AI agents are used in various applications  including virtual assistants  chatbots  autonomous vehicles  game playing systems  and industrial robotics  AI agents operate within   the constraints of their programming  available computational resources  and hardware limitations  This means  they  are  restricted  to  performing  tasks  within  their  defined  scope  and  have  finite  memory  and processing  capabilities   In  real world  applications   AI  agents  often  face  time  constraints  for  decision  making and action execution  Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms  enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training  Using machine learning  AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks                  Other industry specific tasks  There  are  also  thousands  of  successful  AI  applications  used  to  solve  specific  problems  for  specific industries or institutions  In a      survey  one in five companies reported having incorporated  AI  in some  offerings  or  processes        A  few  examples  are  energy  storage   medical  diagnosis   military logistics   applications  that  predict  the  result  of  judicial  decisions   foreign  policy   or  supply  chain management   AI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing  AI has been used to investigate if and  how  people  evacuated  in  large  scale  and  small  scale  evacuations  using  historical  data  from  GPS  videos  or  social  media   Further   AI  can  provide  real  time  information  on  the  real  time  evacuation conditions                  In agriculture  AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation  fertilization  pesticide treatments or increasing yield  Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development  AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes  monitor soil moisture  operate agricultural robots  conduct predictive analytics  classify livestock pig call emotions  automate greenhouses  detect diseases and pests  and save water   Artificial  intelligence  is  used  in  astronomy  to  analyze  increasing  amounts  of  available  data  and applications  mainly for  classification  regression  clustering  forecasting  generation  discovery  and the development of new scientific insights   For example  it is used for discovering exoplanets  forecasting solar  activity   and  distinguishing  between  signals  and  instrumental  effects  in  gravitational  wave astronomy  Additionally  it could be used for activities in space  such as space exploration  including the analysis of data from space missions  real time science decisions of spacecraft  space debris avoidance  and more autonomous operation   During the      Indian elections  US    millions

local languages        Ethics  AI has potential benefits and potential risks       AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems  Demis Hassabis of Deep Mind hopes to  solve intelligence  and then use that to solve everything  else         However   as  the  use  of  AI  has  become  widespread   several  unintended   consequences and risks have been identified       In production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes  especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning        Risks and harm  Privacy and copyright  Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data  The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy  surveillance and copyright   AI powered  devices  and  services   such  as  virtual  assistants  and  IoT  products   continuously  collect personal  information   raising  concerns  about  intrusive  data  gathering  and  unauthorized  access  by  third parties  The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI s ability to process and combine vast amounts of data  potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency   Sensitive  user  data  collected  may  include  online  activity  records   geolocation  data   video  or  audio       For example  in order to build speech recognition algorithms  Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations  and  allowed  temporary  workers  to  listen  to  and  transcribe  some  of  them        Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy        AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications  and have developed several techniques  that  attempt  to  preserve  privacy  while  still  obtaining  the  data   such  as  data  aggregation   de  identification  and  differential  privacy        Since         some  privacy  experts   such  as  Cynthia  Dwork  have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness  Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted  from the question of  what they know  to the question of  what they re doing with it          Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works  including in domains such as images or computer code  the output is then used under the rationale of  fair use   Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law  relevant factors may include  the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work  and  the effect upon the potential market for  the  copyrighted  work

  sued  AI  companies  for  using  their  work  to  train  generative  AI             Another  discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors        Dominance by tech giants  The  commercial AI  scene  is  dominated  by  Big Tech  companies  such  as Alphabet  Inc   Amazon  Apple Inc   Meta Platforms  and Microsoft                 Some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers  allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace             Substantial power needs and other environmental impacts   In January       the International Energy Agency  IEA  released Electricity       Analysis and Forecast to         forecasting  electric  power  use        This  is  the  first  IEA  report  to  make  projections  for  data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency  The report states that power demand  for  these  uses  might  double  by         with  additional  electric  power  usage  equal  to  electricity used by the whole Japanese nation        Prodigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuels use  and might delay closings of obsolete  carbon emitting coal energy facilities  There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US  making large technology firms  e g   Microsoft  Meta  Google  Amazon  into  voracious  consumers  of  electric  power   Projected  electric  consumption  is  so  immense  that  there  is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source  A ChatGPT search involves the use of    times the electrical energy as a Google search  The large firms are in haste to find power sources   from nuclear energy  to  geothermal  to  fusion   The  tech  firms  argue  that     in  the  long  view    AI  will  be  eventually kinder  to  the  environment   but  they  need  the  energy  now  AI  makes  the  power  grid  more  efficient  and  intelligent   will assist in the growth of nuclear power  and track overall carbon emissions  according to technology firms        A        Goldman  Sachs  Research  Paper   AI  Data  Centers  and  the  Coming  US  Power  Demand  Surge  found  US power demand  is  likely to experience growth not seen in a generation      and forecasts that  by       US data centers will consume    of US power  as opposed to    in       presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means       Data centers  need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid  The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all        In         the  Wall  Street  Journal  reported  that  big AI  companies  have  begun  negotiations  with  the  US nuclear  power  providers  to  provide  electricity  to  the  data  centers   In  March       Amazon  purchased  a Pennsylvania nuclear powered data center for      Million  US         In September       Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with      of all electric power produced by the plant for    years  Reopening the plant  which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit   reactor in        will  require  Constellation  to  get  through  strict  regulatory  processes  which  will  include  extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission  If approved  this will be the first ever US re commissioning  of  a  nuclear  plant    over       megawatts  of  power     enough  for           homes     of energy will be produced  The cost for re opening and upgrading is estimated at      billion  US  and is dependent  on  tax  breaks  for  nuclear  power  contained  in  the        US  Inflation  Reduction Act       The US  government  and  the  state  of  Michigan  are  investing  almost      billion   US   to  reopen  the  Palisades Nuclear  reactor  on  Lake  Michigan   Closed  since         the  plant  is  planned  to  be  reopened  in  October       The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane  a nuclear  proponent  and  former  CEO  of  Exelon  who  was  responsible  for  Exelon

user engagement  that is  the only goal was to keep people watching   The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation  conspiracy theories  and extreme partisan content  and  to keep them watching  the AI recommended more of it  Users also tended to watch   more content on the same subject  so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation       This convinced many users that the misinformation was true  and ultimately undermined trust in institutions  the media and the government       The AI program had correctly  learned  to  maximize  its  goal   but  the  result  was  harmful  to  society  After  the  U S   election  in       major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem    In       generative AI began to create images  audio  video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs  recordings  films  or human writing  It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create  massive  amounts  of  misinformation  or  propaganda        AI  pioneer  Geoffrey  Hinton  expressed concern about AI enabling  authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates  on a large scale  among other risks        Algorithmic bias and fairness Machine learning applications will be biased k  if they learn from biased data       The developers may not be aware that the bias exists       Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed            If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm  people   as  it  can  in  medicine   finance   recruitment   housing  or  policing   then  the  algorithm  may cause discrimination       The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases   On June           Google Photos s new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as  gorillas  because they were black  The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people       a problem called  sample size disparity        Google  fixed  this problem by preventing  the  system  from  labelling  anything  as  a   gorilla    Eight  years  later   in         Google  Photos still could not identify a gorilla  and neither could similar products from Apple  Facebook  Microsoft and Amazon        COMPAS  is  a  commercial  program  widely  used  by  U S   courts  to  assess  the  likelihood  of  a  defendant becoming  a  recidivist   In         Julia Angwin  at  ProPublica  discovered  that  COMPAS  exhibited  racial bias  despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants  Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly      the errors for each race were different the system  consistently  overestimated  the  chance  that  a  black  person  would  re offend  and  would underestimate  the  chance  that  a  white  person  would  not  re offend        In         several  researchers l  showed  that  it  was  mathematically  impossible  for  COMPAS  to  accommodate  all  possible  measures  of fairness when the base rates of re offense were different for whites and blacks in the data        A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature  such  as   race   or   gender     The  feature  will  correlate  with  other  features   like   address     shopping history   or   first  name     and  the  program  will  make  the  same  decisions  based  on  these  features  as  it would  on   race   or   gender         Moritz  Hardt  said   the  most  robust  fact  in  this  research  area  is  that fairness through blindness doesn t work         Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make  predictions  that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past  If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past  machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future  If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations  some of these    recommendations   will  likely  be  racist        Thus   machine  learning  is  not  well  suited  to  help  make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past  It is descriptive rather than prescriptive  m   Bias  and  unfairness  may  go  undetected  because  the  developers  are  overwhelmingly  white  and  male  among AI engineers  about    are black and     are women        There are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness  These notions depend on ethical  assumptions   and  are  influenced  by  beliefs  about  society   One  broad  category  is  distributive fairness   which  focuses  on  the  outcomes   often  identifying  groups  and  seeking  to  compensate  for statistical disparities  Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible  Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome  The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context  notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders  The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them  Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered  by  many AI  ethicists  to  be  necessary  in  order  to  compensate  for  biases   but  it  may  conflict with anti discrimination laws        At  its        Conference  on  Fairness   Accountability   and  Transparency   ACM  FAccT          the Association  for  Computing  Machinery   in  Seoul   South  Korea   presented  and  published  findings  that recommend  that  until  AI  and  robotics  systems  are  demonstrated  to  be  free  of  bias  mistakes   they  are unsafe   and  the  use  of  self learning  neural  networks  trained  on  vast   unregulated  sources  of  flawed internet data should be curtailed        Lack of transparency Many AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions       Particularly  with  deep  neural  networks   in  which  there  are  a  large  amount  of  non linear  relationships between inputs and outputs  But some popular explainability techniques exist        It is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works  There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests  but nevertheless learned  something  different  than  what  the  programmers  intended   For  example   a  system  that  could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as  cancerous   because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show  the  scale        Another  machine  learning  system  designed  to  help  effectively  allocate  medical resources  was  found  to  classify  patients  with  asthma  as  being  at   low  risk   of  dying  from  pneumonia  Having  asthma  is  actually  a  severe  risk  factor   but  since  the  patients  having  asthma  would  usually  get much  more  medical  care   they  were  relatively  unlikely  to  die  according  to  the  training  data   The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real  but misleading        People who have been harmed by an algorithm s decision have a right to an explanation       Doctors  for example   are  expected  to  clearly  and  completely  explain  to  their  colleagues  the  reasoning  behind  any decision  they  make   Early  drafts  of  the  European  Union s  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  in       included  an  explicit  statement  that  this  right  exists  n   Industry  experts  noted  that  this  is  an  unsolved problem with no solution in sight  Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real  if the problem has no solution  the tools should not be used         DARPA established the XAI   Explainable Artificial Intelligence   program in      to try to solve these problems        Several approaches aim to address the transparency problem  SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of  each  feature  to  the  output        LIME  can  locally  approximate  a  model s  outputs  with  a  simpler  interpretable model       Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification   These  other  outputs  can  help  developers  deduce  what  the  network  has  learned       Deconvolution   DeepDream  and  other  generative  methods  can  allow  developers  to  see  what  different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned  and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning       For generative pre trained transformers  Anthropic developed a technique based on  dictionary  learning  that  associates  patterns  of  neuron  activations  with  human understandable concepts        Bad actors and weaponized AI  Artificial  intelligence  provides  a  number  of  tools  that  are  useful  to  bad  actors   such  as  authoritarian governments  terrorists  criminals or rogue states   A lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates  selects and engages human targets without human supervision  o  Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and  if produced at scale  they are potentially weapons of mass destruction       Even when used in  conventional  warfare   it  is  unlikely  that  they  will  be  unable  to  reliably  choose  targets  and  could potentially  kill  an  innocent  person        In             nations   including  China   supported  a  ban  on autonomous weapons under the United Nations  Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons  however the United States and others disagreed       By       over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots        AI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways  Face  and  voice  recognition  allow  widespread  surveillance   Machine  learning   operating  this  data   can classify  potential  enemies  of  the  state  and  prevent  them  from  hiding   Recommendation  systems  can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect  Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing  misinformation   Advanced  AI  can  make  authoritarian  centralized  decision  making  more competitive  than  liberal  and  decentralized  systems  such  as  markets   It  lowers  the  cost  and  difficulty  of digital  warfare  and  advanced  spyware        All  these  technologies  have  been  available  since        or earlier AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China             There many other ways that AI is expected to help bad actors  some of which can not be foreseen  For example   machine learning  AI  is  able  to  design  tens  of  thousands  of  toxic  molecules  in  a  matter  of hours        Technological unemployment  Economists  have  frequently  highlighted  the  risks  of  redundancies  from  AI   and  speculated  about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment        In  the  past   technology  has  tended  to  increase  rather  than  reduce  total  employment   but  economists acknowledge  that   we re  in  uncharted  territory   with  AI        A  survey  of  economists  showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long    term  unemployment   but  they  generally  agree  that  it  could  be  a  net  benefit  if  productivity  gains  are redistributed        Risk  estimates  vary   for  example   in  the      s   Michael  Osborne  and  Carl  Benedikt Frey  estimated       of  U S   jobs  are  at   high  risk   of  potential  automation   while  an  OECD  report classified  only      of  U S   jobs  as   high  risk   p        The  methodology  of  speculating  about  future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation  and for implying that technology  rather than social policy  creates unemployment  as opposed to redundancies       In April       it was reported  that       of  the  jobs  for  Chinese  video  game  illustrators  had  been  eliminated  by  generative artificial intelligence             Unlike  previous  waves  of  automation   many  middle class  jobs  may  be  eliminated  by  artificial intelligence   The  Economist  stated  in        that   the  worry  that AI  could  do  to  white collar  jobs  what steam  power  did  to  blue collar  ones  during  the  Industrial  Revolution   is   worth  taking  seriously        Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks  while job demand is likely to increase for care related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy        From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence  there have been arguments  for example  those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum  about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them  given the difference between computers and humans  and between quantitative calculation and qualitative  value based judgement        Existential risk  It  has  been  argued AI  will  become  so  powerful  that  humanity  may  irreversibly  lose  control  of  it   This could  as physicist Stephen Hawking stated   spell the end of the human race        This scenario has been common in science fiction  when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human like  self awareness   or   sentience   or   consciousness    and  becomes  a  malevolent  character  q   These  sci fi  scenarios  are misleading in several ways   First  AI does not require human like  sentience  to be an existential risk  Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them  Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI  it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it  he used the example of a paperclip factory manager        Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot  that  tries  to  find  a  way  to  kill  its  owner  to  prevent  it  from  being  unplugged   reasoning  that   you can t fetch the coffee if you re dead        In order to be safe for humanity  a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity s morality and values so that it is  fundamentally on our side         Second  Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential  risk   The  essential  parts  of  civilization  are  not  physical   Things  like  ideologies   law  government   money  and  the  economy  are  made  of  language   they  exist  because  there  are  stories  that billions  of  people  believe   The  current  prevalence  of  misinformation  suggests  that  an  AI  could  use language to convince people to believe anything  even to take actions that are destructive        The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed  with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI       Personalities such as Stephen Hawking  Bill Gates   and  Elon  Musk        as  well  as  AI  pioneers  such  as  Yoshua  Bengio   Stuart  Russell   Demis Hassabis  and Sam Altman  have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI    In May       Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to  freely speak out  about  the  risks  of AI   without   considering  how  this  impacts  Google         He  notably  mentioned risks  of  an AI  takeover        and  stressed  that  in  order  to  avoid  the  worst  outcomes   establishing  safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI        In       many leading AI experts issued the joint statement that  Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war         Other researchers  however  spoke in favor of a less dystopian view  AI pioneer Juergen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement  emphasising that in     of all cases  AI research is about making  human lives longer and healthier and easier        While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also  be  used  by  bad  actors    they  can  also  be  used  against  the  bad  actors              Andrew  Ng  also argued  that   it s  a  mistake  to  fall  for  the  doomsday  hype  on AI and  that  regulators  who  do  will  only benefit  vested  interests         Yann  LeCun   scoffs  at  his  peers   dystopian  scenarios  of  supercharged misinformation and even  eventually  human extinction        In the early     s  experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine       However  after       the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research        Ethical machines and alignment  Friendly AI  are  machines  that  have  been  designed  from  the  beginning  to  minimize  risks  and  to  make choices that benefit humans  Eliezer Yudkowsky  who coined the term  argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority  it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk        Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions  The field of  machine  ethics  provides  machines  with  ethical  principles  and  procedures  for  resolving  ethical dilemmas       The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality       and was founded at an AAAI symposium in             Other  approaches  include  Wendell  Wallach s   artificial  moral  agents        and  Stuart  J   Russell s  three principles for developing provably beneficial machines        Open source Active  organizations  in  the  AI  open source  community  include  Hugging  Face        Google       EleutherAI  and  Meta       Various AI  models   such  as  Llama      Mistral  or  Stable  Diffusion   have  been made  open weight             meaning  that  their  architecture  and  trained  parameters   the   weights    are publicly available  Open weight models can be freely fine tuned  which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use case       Open weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused  Since they can be fine tuned  any built in security measure  such as objecting to harmful requests  can be trained away until it becomes ineffective  Some researchers warn   that  future AI  models  may  develop  dangerous  capabilities   such  as  the  potential  to  drastically  facilitate bioterrorism  and that once released on the Internet  they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed  They recommend pre release audits and cost benefit analyses        Frameworks  Artificial  Intelligence  projects  can  have  their  ethical  permissibility  tested  while  designing   developing  and implementing an AI system  An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework containing the SUM values developed by the Alan Turing Institute tests projects in four main areas             Respect the dignity of individual people Connect with other people sincerely  openly  and inclusively Care for the wellbeing of everyone Protect social values  justice  and the public interest  Other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference  the  Montreal  Declaration  for  Responsible AI   and  the  IEEE s  Ethics  of Autonomous  Systems  initiative  among others       however  these principles do not go without their criticisms  especially regards to the people chosen contributes to these frameworks        Promotion  of  the  wellbeing  of  the  people  and  communities  that  these  technologies  affect  requires consideration  of  the  social  and  ethical  implications  at  all  stages  of AI  system  design   development  and implementation   and  collaboration  between  job  roles  such  as  data  scientists   product  managers   data engineers  domain experts  and delivery managers        The  UK AI  Safety  Institute  released  in        a  testing  toolset  called   Inspect   for AI  safety  evaluations available under a MIT open source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third party packages  It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge  ability to reason  and autonomous capabilities        Regulation  The  regulation  of  artificial  intelligence  is  the  development of  public  sector  policies  and  laws  for  promoting  and regulating AI  it is therefore related to the broader regulation of  algorithms       The  regulatory  and  policy  landscape  for AI  is  an  emerging  issue  in  jurisdictions  globally       According  to  AI  Index  at  Stanford   the  annual  number  of AI related  laws  passed  in  the       survey  countries  jumped from  one  passed  in       alone             Between        and         more  than     countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI       Most EU member  states  had  released  national  AI  strategies   as  had Canada   China   India   Japan   Mauritius   the  Russian Federation   Saudi Arabia   United Arab  Emirates   U S    and Vietnam  Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy  including Bangladesh  Malaysia and Tunisia       The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June       stating a need  for AI  to  be  developed  in  accordance  with  human  rights  and  democratic  values   to  ensure  public  The first global AI Safety Summit was held in      with a declaration calling for international co operation   to      passed   in          confidence  and  trust  in  the  technology        Henry  Kissinger   Eric  Schmidt   and  Daniel  Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November      calling for a government commission to regulate AI       In       OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence  which they believe  may  happen  in  less  than      years        In         the  United  Nations  also  launched  an  advisory body  to  provide  recommendations  on  AI  governance   the  body  comprises  technology  company executives   governments  officials  and  academics        In         the  Council  of  Europe  created  the  first international  legally  binding  treaty  on AI   called  the   Framework  Convention  on Artificial  Intelligence and Human Rights  Democracy and the Rule of Law   It was adopted by the European Union  the United States  the United Kingdom  and other signatories        In a      Ipsos survey  attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country      of Chinese citizens  but only     of Americans  agreed that  products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks        A      Reuters Ipsos poll found that     of Americans agree  and     disagree  that AI poses risks to humanity       In a      Fox News poll      of Americans thought it  very important   and an additional     thought it  somewhat important   for the federal government to regulate AI  versus     responding  not very important  and    responding  not at all important              In November       the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks          countries including the United States  China  and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of  the  summit   calling  for  international  co operation  to  manage  the  challenges  and  risks  of  artificial intelligence            In May      at the AI Seoul Summit     global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI             History  The study of mechanical or  formal  reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity  The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing s theory of computation  which suggested that a machine  by  shuffling  symbols  as  simple  as       and        could  simulate  any  conceivable  form  of  mathematical reasoning             This   along  with  concurrent  discoveries  in  cybernetics   information  theory  and neurobiology   led  researchers  to  consider  the  possibility  of  building  an   electronic  brain   r   They developed  several  areas  of  research  that  would  become  part  of AI        such  as  McCullouch  and  Pitts design  for   artificial  neurons   in              and  Turing s  influential        paper   Computing  Machinery and  Intelligence    which  introduced  the  Turing  test  and  showed  that   machine  intelligence   was plausible             The  field  of AI  research  was  founded  at  a  workshop  at  Dartmouth  College  in        s     The  attendees became  the  leaders  of AI  research  in  the      s  t   They  and  their  students  produced  programs  that  the press described as  astonishing   u  computers were learning checkers strategies  solving word problems in  algebra   proving  logical  theorems  and  speaking  English  v     Artificial  intelligence  laboratories  were set up at a number of British and U S  universities in the latter     s and early     s        Researchers in the     s and the     s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating  a  machine  with  general  intelligence  and  considered  this  the  goal  of  their  field        In       Herbert Simon predicted   machines will be capable  within twenty years  of doing any work a man can do         In        Marvin  Minsky  agreed   writing  that   within  a  generation       the  problem  of  creating    artificial intelligence  will substantially be solved        They had  however  underestimated the difficulty of  the  problem  w   In         both  the  U S   and  British  governments  cut  off  exploratory  research  in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill      and ongoing pressure from the U S  Congress to fund more  productive  projects        Minsky s  and  Papert s  book  Perceptrons  was  understood  as  proving  that artificial  neural  networks  would  never  be  useful  for  solving  real world  tasks   thus  discrediting  the approach altogether       The  AI winter   a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult  followed      In the early     s  AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems       a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts  By       the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars  At the same time  Japan s fifth generation computer project inspired the U S  and British governments to restore funding for academic research     However  beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in       AI once again fell into disrepute  and a second  longer  lasting winter began       Up  to  this  point   most  of AI s  funding  had  gone  to  projects  that  used  high level  symbols  to  represent mental objects like plans  goals  beliefs  and known facts  In the     s  some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition  especially perception  robotics   learning  and  pattern  recognition        and  began  to  look  into   sub symbolic   approaches       Rodney Brooks rejected  representation  in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive  x  Judea Pearl  Lofti Zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain  information  by  making  reasonable  guesses  rather  than  precise  logic            But  the  most important  development  was  the  revival  of   connectionism    including  neural  network  research   by Geoffrey  Hinton  and  others        In         Yann  LeCun  successfully  showed  that  convolutional  neural networks  can  recognize  handwritten  digits   the  first  of  many  successful  applications  of  neural networks        AI  gradually  restored  its  reputation  in  the  late      s  and  early    st  century  by  exploiting  formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems  This  narrow  and  formal  focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields  such as statistics  economics  and  mathematics         By         solutions  developed  by AI  researchers  were  being  widely used  although in the     s they were rarely described as  artificial intelligence   a tendency known as the  AI  effect         However   several  academic  researchers  became  concerned  that  AI  was  no  longer pursuing  its  original  goal  of  creating  versatile   fully  intelligent  machines   Beginning  around         they founded  the  subfield  of  artificial  general  intelligence   or   AGI     which  had  several  well funded institutions by the     s      Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in      and was adopted throughout the field      For  many  specific  tasks   other  methods  were  abandoned  y   Deep  learning s  success  was  based  on  both hardware  improvements   faster  computers        graphics  processing  units   cloud  computing        and access to large amounts of data       including curated datasets       such as ImageNet   Deep learning s success  led  to  an  enormous  increase  in  interest  and  funding  in AI  z   The  amount  of  machine  learning research  measured by total publications  increased by     in the years                  In         issues  of  fairness  and  the  misuse  of  technology  were  catapulted  into  center  stage  at  machine learning conferences  publications vastly increased  funding became available  and many researchers re  focussed  their  careers  on  these  issues   The  alignment  problem  became  a  serious  field  of  academic   study        In  the  late  teens  and  early      s   AGI  companies  began  to  deliver  programs  that  created  enormous interest  In       AlphaGo  developed by DeepMind  beat the world champion Go player  The program was taught only the rules of the game and developed strategy by itself  GPT   is a large language model that  was  released  in        by  OpenAI  and  is  capable  of  generating  high quality  human like  text       These  programs   and  others   inspired  an  aggressive AI  boom   where  large  companies  began  investing billions in AI research  According to AI Impacts  about     billion annually was invested in  AI  around      in the U S  alone and about     of the new U S  Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in  AI        About          AI  related U S  job openings existed in             Philosophy  Philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent  machines        Another  major  focus  has  been  whether  machines  can  be  conscious   and  the associated  ethical  implications        Many  other  topics  in  philosophy  are  relevant  to  AI   such  as epistemology  and  free  will        Rapid  advancements  have  intensified  public  discussions  on  the philosophy and ethics of AI        Defining artificial intelligence Alan  Turing  wrote  in         I  propose  to  consider  the  question   can  machines  think          He  advised changing the question from whether a machine  thinks   to  whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour        He devised the Turing test  which measures the ability of a machine to simulate  human  conversation        Since  we  can  only  observe  the  behavior  of  the  machine   it  does  not matter if it is  actually  thinking or literally has a  mind   Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but  it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks         Russell  and  Norvig  agree  with  Turing  that  intelligence  must  be defined  in  terms  of  external  behavior   not  internal  structure     However   they  are  critical  that  the  test  requires  the  machine  to imitate humans   Aeronautical engineering texts   they wrote   do not  define  the  goal  of  their  field  as  making   machines  that  fly  so exactly  like  pigeons  that  they  can  fool  other  pigeons           AI founder  that   Artificial intelligence  is  not   by  definition   simulation  of  human intelligence         John  McCarthy  agreed   writing   McCarthy  defines  intelligence  as   the  computational  part  of  the ability  to  achieve  goals  in  the  world         Another  AI  founder  Marvin Minsky similarly describes it as  the ability to solve hard problems        The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals      These  definitions  view  intelligence  in  terms  of  well defined  problems  with  well defined  The Turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence  but it penalizes non human intelligent behavior         solutions   where  both  the  difficulty  of  the  problem  and  the  performance  of  the  program  are  direct measures of the  intelligence  of the machine and no other philosophical discussion is required  or may not even be possible   Another definition has been adopted by Google       a major practitioner in the field of AI  This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence  similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence   Some authors have suggested in practice  that the definition of AI is vague and difficult to define  with contention  as  to  whether  classical  algorithms  should  be  categorised  as  AI        with  many  companies during  the  early      s AI  boom  using  the  term  as  a  marketing  buzzword   often  even  if  they  did   not actually use AI in a material way         Evaluating approaches to AI No  established  unifying  theory  or  paradigm  has  guided  AI  research  for  most  of  its  history  aa   The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the     s eclipsed all other approaches  so much so  that  some  sources   especially  in  the  business  world   use  the  term   artificial  intelligence   to  mean  machine learning with neural networks    This approach is mostly sub symbolic  soft and narrow  Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers   Symbolic AI and its limits Symbolic AI  or  GOFAI        simulated the high level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles  express legal reasoning and do mathematics  They were highly successful at  intelligent  tasks such as algebra or IQ tests  In the     s  Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis    A  physical  symbol  system  has  the  necessary  and  sufficient  means  of  general  intelligent action         However   the  symbolic  approach  failed  on  many  tasks  that  humans  solve  easily   such  as  learning  recognizing  an  object  or  commonsense  reasoning   Moravec s  paradox  is  the  discovery  that  high level  intelligent   tasks  were  easy  for  AI   but  low  level   instinctive   tasks  were  extremely  difficult       Philosopher  Hubert  Dreyfus  had  argued  since  the      s  that  human  expertise  depends  on  unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation  and on having a  feel  for the situation  rather than explicit  symbolic  knowledge        Although  his  arguments  had  been  ridiculed  and  ignored  when  they were first presented  eventually  AI research came to agree with him  ab       The issue is not resolved  sub symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does  such as algorithmic bias  Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into  symbolic  AI  will  still  be  necessary  to  attain  general  intelligence             in  part  because  sub  symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI  it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision  The emerging field of neuro symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches   Neat vs  scruffy    Neats   hope  that  intelligent  behavior  is  described  using  simple   elegant  principles   such  as  logic  optimization  or neural networks    Scruffies  expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated  problems   Neats  defend  their  programs  with  theoretical  rigor   scruffies  rely  mainly  on incremental testing to see if they work  This issue was actively discussed in the     s and     s       but eventually was seen as irrelevant  Modern AI has elements of both   Soft vs  hard computing Finding  a  provably  correct  or  optimal  solution  is  intractable  for  many  important  problems       Soft computing is a set of techniques  including genetic algorithms  fuzzy logic and neural networks  that are tolerant  of  imprecision   uncertainty   partial  truth  and  approximation   Soft  computing  was  introduced  in the late     s and most successful AI programs in the   st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks   Narrow vs  general AI  AI  researchers  are  divided  as  to  whether  to  pursue  the  goals  of  artificial  general  intelligence  and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible  narrow AI  in hopes these solutions  will  lead  indirectly  to  the  field s  long term  goals             General  intelligence  is  difficult  to define and difficult to measure  and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems  with  specific  solutions   The  sub field  of  artificial  general  intelligence  studies  this  area exclusively   Machine consciousness  sentience  and mind  The philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind  consciousness and mental states   in  the  same  sense  that  human  beings  do   This  issue  considers  the  internal  experiences  of  the machine  rather than its external behavior  Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it  does  not  affect  the  goals  of  the  field   to  build  machines  that  can  solve  problems  using  intelligence  Russell and Norvig add that   t he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on        However  the question has become central to the philosophy of mind  It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction   Consciousness  David  Chalmers  identified  two  problems  in  understanding  the  mind   which  he  named  the   hard   and  easy   problems  of  consciousness        The  easy  problem  is  understanding  how  the  brain  processes signals   makes  plans  and  controls  behavior   The  hard  problem  is  explaining  how  this  feels  or  why  it should feel like anything at all  assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something  Dennett s consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion   While human information processing is easy to explain  human subjective experience is difficult to explain  For example  it is easy to imagine a color  blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red  but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like        Computationalism and functionalism   Computationalism  is  the  position  in  the  philosophy  of  mind  that  the  human  mind  is  an  information processing  system  and  that  thinking  is  a  form  of  computing   Computationalism  argues  that  the relationship  between  mind  and  body  is  similar  or  identical  to  the  relationship  between  software  and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind body problem  This philosophical position was inspired by  the  work  of  AI  researchers  and  cognitive  scientists  in  the      s  and  was  originally  proposed  by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam        Philosopher  John  Searle  characterized  this  position  as   strong  AI     The  appropriately  programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds   ac  Searle counters this assertion with his Chinese room argument  which attempts to show that  even if a machine perfectly simulates human behavior  there is still no reason to suppose it also has a mind        AI welfare and rights  It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient  has the ability to feel   and if so  to what degree       But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer  then  it  may  be  entitled  to  certain  rights  or  welfare  protection  measures   similarly  to  animals            Sapience   a  set  of  capacities  related  to  high  intelligence   such  as  discernment  or  self awareness   may provide  another  moral  basis  for AI  rights        Robot  rights  are  also  sometimes  proposed  as  a  practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society        In       the European Union considered granting  electronic personhood  to some of the most capable AI systems   Similarly  to  the  legal  status  of  companies   it  would  have  conferred  rights  but  also responsibilities        Critics  argued  in        that  granting  rights  to  AI  systems  would  downplay  the importance  of  human  rights   and  that  legislation  should  focus  on  user  needs  rather  than  speculative futuristic  scenarios   They  also  noted  that  robots  lacked  the  autonomy  to  take  part  to  society  on  their own             Progress  in AI  increased  interest  in  the  topic   Proponents  of AI  welfare  and  rights  often  argue  that AI sentience  if it emerges  would be particularly easy to deny  They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming  which could lead to large scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited             Future  Superintelligence and the singularity  A  superintelligence  is  a  hypothetical  agent  that  would  possess  intelligence  far  surpassing  that  of  the brightest  and  most  gifted  human  mind      If  research  into  artificial  general  intelligence  produced sufficiently intelligent software  it might be able to reprogram and improve itself  The improved software would be even better at improving itself  leading to what I  J  Good called an  intelligence explosion  and Vernor Vinge called a  singularity          However   technologies  cannot  improve  exponentially  indefinitely   and  typically  follow  an  S shaped curve  slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do        Transhumanism  Robot designer Hans Moravec  cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either   This  idea   called  transhumanism   has  roots  in  the  writings  of  Aldous  Huxley  and  Robert Ettinger        Edward Fredkin argues that  artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution   an idea first proposed by Samuel  Butler s   Darwin  among  the  Machines   as  far  back  as         and  expanded  upon  by  George Dyson in his      book Darwin Among the Machines  The Evolution of Global Intelligence        In fiction  Thought capable  artificial  beings  have  appeared  as storytelling  devices  since  antiquity        and  have  been  a persistent theme in science fiction        A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley s Frankenstein   where  a  human  creation  becomes  a  threat  to its masters  This includes such works as Arthur C  Clarke s and Stanley Kubrick s       A Space Odyssey  both        with  HAL         the  murderous  computer  in  charge  of  the Discovery One spaceship  as well as The Terminator        and  The  Matrix           In  contrast   the  rare  loyal  robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still        and Bishop from Aliens        are less prominent in popular culture        The word  robot  itself was coined by Karel  apek in his      play R U R   the title standing for  Rossum s Universal Robots    Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories  most notably with the  Multivac  super intelligent  computer   Asimov s  laws  are  often  brought  up  during  lay  discussions  of  machine ethics        while  almost  all  artificial  intelligence  researchers  are  familiar  with  Asimov s  laws  through popular  culture   they  generally  consider  the  laws  useless  for  many  reasons   one  of  which  is  their ambiguity        Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human  showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel  and thus to suffer  This appears in Karel  apek s R U R   the films A I  Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina  as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep   by Philip K  Dick  Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence        See also

of fairness  it refers to a tendency in favor or against a certain group or individual characteristic  usually in a way that is considered unfair or harmful  A statistically unbiased AI system that produces disparate outcomes for different demographic groups may thus be viewed as biased in the ethical sense        l  Including Jon Kleinberg  Cornell University   Sendhil Mullainathan  University

    "example = \"India's information technology (IT) sector is upbeat about President Donald Trump’s return to the Oval Office. The mood is high despite concerns over potential changes to US immigration laws. Immigration experts and analysts have warned that Trump may go stricter on H-1B and other immigration laws during his second tenure as the US President.Donald Trump's previous term saw an increase in salaries for H1B workers as well as visa fee. In this term, the Trump administration may reconsider the annual allotment of H1B work visas, currently capped at 85,000. H1B applications could face tougher scrutiny, as denial rates under the previous Trump administration reached an all-time high of 24%. The duration and eligibility for Optional Practical Training (OPT) for international students may also come under review.Despite these concerns, India’s IT companies celebrated the Republican victory as tech stocks led the rally on India’s benchmark stock indices. IT stocks appreciated sharply, fueling a rally in the benchmark indices after it became clear that Donald Trump will take over as the next US president for the second term. Shares of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) surged 4.21 per cent, Infosys jumped 4.02 per cent, Tech Mahindra soared 3.85 per cent, and HCL Technologies climbed 3.71 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).

       "\"India's information technology (IT) sector is upbeat about President Donald Trump’s return to the Oval Office. The mood is high despite concerns over potential changes to US immigration laws. Immigration experts and analysts have warned that Trump may go stricter on H-1B and other immigration laws during his second tenure as the US President.Donald Trump's previous term saw an increase in salaries for H1B workers as well as visa fee. In this term, the Trump administration may reconsider the annual allotment of H1B work visas, currently capped at 85,000. H1B applications could face tougher scrutiny, as denial rates under the previous Trump administration reached an all-time high of 24%. The duration and eligibility for Optional Practical Training (OPT) for international students may also come under review.Despite these concerns, India’s IT companies celebrated the Republican victory as tech stocks led the rally on India’s benchmark stock indices. IT stocks appreciated sharply, fueling a rally in the benchmark indices after it became clear that Donald Trump will take over as the next US president for the second term. Shares of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) surged 4.21 per cent, Infosys jumped 4.02 per cent, Tech Mahindra soared 3.85 per cent, and HCL Technologies climbed 3.71 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Also, Persistent Systems zoomed 5.86 per cent, LTIMindtree jumped 4.75 percent, and Wipro advanced 3.75 per cent.So what is it that is pepping up the mood in favour of Indian IT companies?\""

       "'कृत्रिम बुद्धिमत्ता\\n\\nकृत्रिम बुद्धिमत्ता (AI), अपने व्यापक अर्थ में, मशीनों, विशेष रूप से कंप्यूटर सिस्टम द्वारा प्रदर्शित बुद्धिमत्ता है। यह कंप्यूटर विज्ञान में अनुसंधान का एक क्षेत्र है जो ऐसी विधियों और सॉफ़्टवेयर का विकास और अध्ययन करता है जो मशीनों को उनके पर्यावरण को समझने और सीखने और बुद्धिमत्ता का उपयोग करके ऐसी क्रियाएँ करने में सक्षम बनाते हैं जो परिभाषित लक्ष्यों को प्राप्त करने की उनकी संभावनाओं को अधिकतम करती हैं।[1] ऐसी मशीनों को AI कहा जा सकता है।\\n\\nAI के कुछ हाई-प्रोफाइल अनुप्रयोगों में उन्नत वेब खोज इंजन (जैसे, Google खोज); अनुशंसा प्रणाली (YouTube, Amazon और Netflix द्वारा उपयोग की जाने वाली); मानव भाषण के माध्यम से बातचीत करना (जैसे, Google सहायक, सिरी और एलेक्सा); स्वायत्त वाहन (जैसे, Waymo); जनरेटिव और रचनात्मक उपकरण (जैसे, ChatGPT और AI कला); और रणनीति खेलों में अलौकिक खेल और विश्लेषण (जैसे, शतरंज और गो) शामिल हैं।\\nहालाँकि, कई AI अनुप्रयोगों को AI के रूप में नहीं माना जाता है: \"बहुत सारे अत्याधुनिक AI सामान्य अनुप्रयोगों में फ़िल्टर हो गए हैं, अक्सर AI कहे बिना क्योंकि एक बार जब कोई चीज़ पर्याप्त उपयोगी और सामान्य हो जाती है तो उसे अब AI नहीं कहा जाता है।\"[2][3]\\n\\nAI अनुसंधान के विभिन्न उपक्षेत्र विशेष लक्ष्यों और विशेष उपकरणों के उपयोग के इर्द-गिर्द केंद्रित हैं। AI अनुसंधान के पारंपरिक लक्ष्यों में तर्क, ज्ञान प्रतिनिधित्व, योजना, सीखना, प्राकृतिक भाषा प्रसंस्करण, धारणा और रोबोटिक्स के लिए समर्थन शामिल हैं।[a] सामान्य बुद्धिमत्ता - किसी भी कार्य को पूरा करने की क्षमता जो किसी मानव द्वारा कम से कम समान स्तर पर किया जा सकता है - इस क्षेत्र के दीर्घकालिक लक्ष्यों में से एक है।[4] इन लक्ष्यों तक पहुँचने के लिए, AI शोधकर्ताओं ने खोज और गणितीय अनुकूलन, औपचारिक तर्क, कृत्रिम तंत्रिका नेटवर्क और सांख्यिकी, संचालन अनुसंधान और अर्थशास्त्र पर आधारित विधियों सहित कई तकनीकों को अनुकूलित और एकीकृत किया है।[b] AI मनोविज्ञान, भाषा विज्ञान, दर्शन, तंत्रिका विज्ञान और अन्य क्षेत्रों से भी प्रेरणा लेता है।[5]\\n\\nकृत्रिम बुद्धिमत्ता की स्थापना 1956 में एक अकादमिक अनुशासन के रूप में की गई थी,[6] और यह क्षेत्र आशावाद के कई चक्रों से गुजरा,[7][8] जिसके बाद निराशा और फंडिंग की कमी के दौर आए, जिन्हें एआई विंटर के नाम से जाना जाता है।[9][10] 2012 के बाद फंडिंग और रुचि में काफी वृद्धि हुई जब डीप लर्निंग ने पिछली एआई तकनीकों से बेहतर प्रदर्शन किया।[11] 2017 के बाद ट्रांसफॉर्मर आर्किटेक्चर के साथ यह वृद्धि और तेज हो गई,[12] और 2020 की शुरुआत तक एआई में सैकड़ों अरबों डॉलर का निवेश किया जा रहा था (जिसे \"एआई बूम\" के रूप में जाना जाता है)। 21वीं सदी में एआई के व्यापक उपयोग ने वर्तमान में कई अनपेक्षित परिणामों और नुकसानों को उजागर किया और भविष्य में इसके जोखिमों और दीर्घकालिक प्रभावों के बारे में चिंताएँ पैदा कीं, जिससे प्रौद्योगिकी की सुरक्षा और लाभों को सुनिश्चित करने के लिए नियामक नीतियों के बारे में चर्चाएँ हुईं।\\n\\nलक्ष्य\\n\\nबुद्धिमत्ता का अनुकरण (या निर्माण) करने की सामान्य समस्या को उप-समस्याओं में विभाजित किया गया है। इनमें विशेष गुण या क्षमताएँ शामिल हैं, जिनकी अपेक्षा शोधकर्ता किसी बुद्धिमान प्रणाली से करते हैं। नीचे वर्णित गुणों पर सबसे अधिक ध्यान दिया गया है और ये AI शोध के दायरे को कवर करते हैं।[a]\\n\\nतर्क और समस्या-समाधान\\n\\nशुरुआती शोधकर्ताओं ने ऐसे एल्गोरिदम विकसित किए जो चरण-दर-चरण तर्क की नकल करते थे, जिसका उपयोग मनुष्य पहेलियाँ हल करते समय या तार्किक निष्कर्ष निकालते समय करते हैं।[13] 1980 और 1990 के दशक के अंत तक, सूचना के लिए विधियाँ विकसित की गईं, जिसमें संभाव्यता से अवधारणाओं का उपयोग किया गया और अनिश्चित या अर्थशास्त्र से निपटा गया।[14]\\n\\nअधूरा\\n\\nइनमें से कई एल्गोरिदम बड़ी तर्क समस्याओं को हल करने के लिए अपर्याप्त हैं, क्योंकि वे एक \"संयोजन विस्फोट\" का अनुभव करते हैं: जैसे-जैसे समस्याएँ बढ़ती हैं, वे तेजी से धीमे होते जाते हैं।[15] यहाँ तक कि मनुष्य भी शायद ही कभी चरण-दर-चरण निष्कर्ष का उपयोग करते हैं, जिसे शुरुआती AI शोध मॉडल कर सकते थे। वे अपनी अधिकांश समस्याओं को तेज़, सहज ज्ञान युक्त निर्णयों का उपयोग करके हल करते हैं।[16] सटीक और कुशल तर्क एक अनसुलझी समस्या है। ज्ञान प्रतिनिधित्व\\nज्ञान प्रतिनिधित्व और ज्ञान इंजीनियरिंग[17]\\nAI प्रोग्राम को बुद्धिमानी से सवालों के जवाब देने और वास्तविक दुनिया के तथ्यों के बारे में निष्कर्ष निकालने की अनुमति देते हैं। औपचारिक ज्ञान प्रतिनिधित्व का उपयोग सामग्री-आधारित अनुक्रमण और पुनर्प्राप्ति,[18] दृश्य व्याख्या,[19] नैदानिक \\u200b\\u200bनिर्णय समर्थन,[20] ज्ञान खोज (बड़े डेटाबेस से \"दिलचस्प\" और कार्रवाई योग्य निष्कर्ष निकालना),[21] और अन्य क्षेत्रों में किया जाता है।[22]\\n\\nज्ञान आधार ज्ञान का एक निकाय है जिसे एक ऐसे रूप में दर्शाया जाता है जिसका उपयोग किसी प्रोग्राम द्वारा किया जा सकता है। ऑन्टोलॉजी ज्ञान के एक विशेष डोमेन द्वारा उपयोग की जाने वाली वस्तुओं, संबंधों, अवधारणाओं और गुणों का समूह है।[23] ज्ञान के आधारों को ऐसी चीज़ों का प्रतिनिधित्व करने की ज़रूरत होती है जैसे कि वस्तुएँ, गुण, श्रेणियाँ, और वस्तुओं के बीच संबंध;[24] परिस्थितियाँ, घटनाएँ, अवस्थाएँ और समय;[25] कारण और प्रभाव;[26] ज्ञान के बारे में ज्ञान (हम दूसरे लोगों के बारे में क्या जानते हैं);[27] डिफ़ॉल्ट तर्क (ऐसी चीज़ें जो हम जानते हैं'"

       "'i \\' m really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone . sure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god \\' s green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) , but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in , she always strikes out . the crush was a slow - moving , predictable piece of fluff . hideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in . clueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time . and people have e - mailed me too , saying clueless is a good movie and that i \\' m the only one who doesn \\' t like it . one girl said if i \\' d seen the movie with \" an open mind , \" i would have enjoyed it . nothing could be further from the truth . i went into the theater expecting to love the movie . the preview looked good and of course i \\' m crazymadinlove with alicia , but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters . almost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way . when we were walking out of the theater , one guy ( and it wasn \\' t me ) yelled out , \" that was the worst f $&# in \\' movie i \\' ve ever seen \" and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement . so last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia \\' s pretty face on the cover of some made - for - video thriller called the babysitter . i knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i \\' ll probably never understand made me rent it anyway . what i got was 90 minutes of regret -- the worst alicia silverstone movie ever . and you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like . where to begin in criticizing this movie ? the plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier , the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she \\' s still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever . there is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes , when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence . zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero . so why does this movie get one star out of me ? well , alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub . and if it wasn \\' t bubble bath , the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four - star features , but you settle for what you can get . alicia plays a babysitter who \\' s spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party . and of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home ( at least that movie critic at large guy does ) . as the movie trods along , we discover she \\' s not only the mostly - silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character \\' s fantasies ( and probably every male viewer \\' s too ) . the drunken father thinks she \\' s just the thing to recapture his lost youth , her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside , even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she \\' s taking her bubble bath . they even throw in the middle aged wife \\' s fantasies about a male counterpart at the party . not that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200 + pound woman in a black silk teddy . at least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg - rated . in fact , i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late - night staple if not for the fact that there \\' s absolutely no nudity in it . so you can \\' t call it a sex flick . i \\' ve already pointed out that it can \\' t fall under drama , comedy , thriller or action , so what do you classify the babysitter as ? bad .'"
