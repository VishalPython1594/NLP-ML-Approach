       "'Artificial intelligence\\n\\nArtificial  intelligence  (AI),  in  its  broadest  sense,  is  intelligence  exhibited  by  machines,  particularly\\ncomputer  systems.  It  is  a  field  of  research  in  computer  science  that  develops  and  studies  methods  and\\nsoftware  that  enable  machines  to  perceive  their  environment  and  use  learning  and  intelligence  to  take\\nactions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1] Such machines may be called AIs.\\n\\nSome  high-profile  applications  of  AI  include  advanced  web  search  engines  (e.g.,  Google  Search);\\nrecommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g.,\\nGoogle  Assistant,  Siri,  and  Alexa);  autonomous  vehicles  (e.g.,  Waymo);  generative  and  creative  tools\\n(e.g.,  ChatGPT,  and AI  art);  and  superhuman  play  and  analysis  in  strategy  games  (e.g.,  chess  and  Go).\\nHowever, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general\\napplications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common\\nenough it\\'s not labeled AI anymore.\"[2][3]\\n\\nThe various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools.\\nThe  traditional  goals  of  AI  research  include  reasoning,  knowledge  representation,  planning,  learning,\\nnatural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] General intelligence—the ability to\\ncomplete  any  task  performable  by  a  human  on  an  at  least  equal  level—is  among  the  field\\'s  long-term\\ngoals.[4]  To  reach  these  goals, AI  researchers  have  adapted  and  integrated  a  wide  range  of  techniques,\\nincluding  search  and  mathematical  optimization,  formal  logic,  artificial  neural  networks,  and  methods\\nbased  on  statistics,  operations  research,  and  economics.[b] AI  also  draws  upon  psychology,  linguistics,\\nphilosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.[5]\\n\\nArtificial  intelligence  was  founded  as  an  academic  discipline  in  1956,[6]  and  the  field  went  through\\nmultiple cycles of optimism,[7][8] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as\\nAI  winter.[9][10]  Funding  and  interest  vastly  increased  after  2012  when  deep  learning  outperformed\\nprevious  AI  techniques.[11]  This  growth  accelerated  further  after  2017  with  the \\ntransformer\\narchitecture,[12] and by the early 2020s hundreds of billions of dollars were being invested in AI (known\\nas  the  \"AI  boom\").  The  widespread  use  of  AI  in  the  21st  century  exposed  several  unintended\\nconsequences  and  harms  in  the  present  and  raised  concerns  about  its  risks  and  long-term  effects  in  the\\nfuture,  prompting  discussions  about  regulatory  policies  to  ensure  the  safety  and  benefits  of  the\\ntechnology.\\n\\nGoals\\n\\nThe  general  problem  of  simulating  (or  creating)  intelligence  has  been  broken  into  subproblems.  These\\nconsist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits\\ndescribed below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.[a]\\n\\nReasoning and problem-solving\\n\\n\\x0cEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they\\nsolve puzzles or make logical deductions.[13] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for\\ninformation,  employing  concepts  from  probability  and\\ndealing  with  uncertain  or \\neconomics.[14]\\n\\nincomplete \\n\\nMany of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a\\n\"combinatorial  explosion\":  They  become  exponentially  slower  as  the  problems  grow.[15]  Even  humans\\nrarely  use  the  step-by-step  deduction  that  early  AI  research  could  model.  They  solve  most  of  their\\nproblems using fast, intuitive judgments.[16] Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\\n\\nKnowledge representation\\nKnowledge  representation  and  knowledge  engineering[17]\\nallow  AI  programs  to  answer  questions  intelligently  and\\nmake deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge\\nrepresentations  are  used  in  content-based  indexing  and\\nretrieval,[18]  scene \\ninterpretation,[19]  clinical  decision\\nsupport,[20]  knowledge  discovery  (mining  \"interesting\"  and\\nactionable  inferences  from  large  databases),[21]  and  other\\nareas.[22]\\n\\nA knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a\\nform that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set\\nof  objects,  relations,  concepts,  and  properties  used  by  a\\nparticular domain of knowledge.[23] Knowledge bases need\\nto  represent  things  such  as  objects,  properties,  categories,\\nand  relations  between  objects;[24]  situations,  events,  states,\\nand  time;[25]  causes  and  effects;[26]  knowledge  about\\nknowledge  (what  we  know  about  what  other  people\\nknow);[27] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will\\nremain true even when other facts are changing);[28] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.\\n\\nAn ontology represents knowledge as a set\\nof concepts within a domain and the\\nrelationships between those concepts.\\n\\nAmong  the  most  difficult  problems  in  knowledge  representation  are  the  breadth  of  commonsense\\nknowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);[29] and the sub-symbolic\\nform  of  most  commonsense  knowledge  (much  of  what  people  know  is  not  represented  as  \"facts\"  or\\n\"statements\" that they could express verbally).[16] There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition,\\nthe problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.[c]\\n\\nPlanning and decision-making\\n\\nAn  \"agent\"  is  anything  that  perceives  and  takes  actions  in  the  world.  A  rational  agent  has  goals  or\\npreferences and takes actions to make them happen.[d][32] In automated planning, the agent has a specific\\ngoal.[33]  In  automated  decision-making,  the  agent  has  preferences—there  are  some  situations  it  would\\nprefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to\\neach situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action,\\n\\n\\x0cit can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the\\nprobability  that  the  outcome  will  occur.  It  can  then  choose  the  action  with  the  maximum  expected\\nutility.[34]\\n\\nIn classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.[35] In most real-world\\nproblems,  however,  the  agent  may  not  be  certain  about  the  situation  they  are  in  (it  is  \"unknown\"  or\\n\"unobservable\")  and  it  may  not  know  for  certain  what  will  happen  after  each  possible  action  (it  is  not\\n\"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation\\nto see if the action worked.[36]\\n\\nIn  some  problems,  the  agent\\'s  preferences  may  be  uncertain,  especially  if  there  are  other  agents  or\\nhumans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning), or the agent can seek\\ninformation  to  improve  its  preferences.[37]  Information  value  theory  can  be  used  to  weigh  the  value  of\\nexploratory  or  experimental  actions.[38]  The  space  of  possible  future  actions  and  situations  is  typically\\nintractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the\\noutcome will be.\\n\\nA Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action\\nwill change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and\\nthe  cost  of  each  action.  A  policy  associates  a  decision  with  each  possible  state.  The  policy  could  be\\ncalculated (e.g., by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.[39]\\n\\nGame theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that\\nmake decisions that involve other agents.[40]\\n\\nLearning\\n\\nMachine  learning  is  the  study  of  programs  that  can  improve  their  performance  on  a  given  task\\nautomatically.[41] It has been a part of AI from the beginning.[e]\\n\\nThere are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds\\npatterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.[44] Supervised learning requires a human to\\nlabel the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to\\npredict  what  category  the  input  belongs  in)  and  regression  (where  the  program  must  deduce  a  numeric\\nfunction based on numeric input).[45]\\n\\nIn reinforcement learning, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent\\nlearns  to  choose  responses  that  are  classified  as  \"good\".[46]  Transfer  learning  is  when  the  knowledge\\ngained from one problem is applied to a new problem.[47] Deep learning is a type of machine learning\\nthat  runs  inputs  through  biologically  inspired  artificial  neural  networks  for  all  of  these  types  of\\nlearning.[48]\\n\\nComputational  learning  theory  can  assess  learners  by  computational  complexity,  by  sample  complexity\\n(how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.[49]\\n\\nNatural language processing\\n\\n\\x0cNatural  language  processing  (NLP)[50]  allows  programs  to  read,  write  and  communicate  in  human\\nlanguages  such  as  English.  Specific  problems  include  speech  recognition,  speech  synthesis,  machine\\ntranslation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering.[51]\\n\\nEarly work, based on Noam Chomsky\\'s generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with\\nword-sense  disambiguation[f]  unless  restricted  to  small  domains  called  \"micro-worlds\"  (due  to  the\\ncommon  sense  knowledge  problem[29]).  Margaret  Masterman  believed  that  it  was  meaning  and  not\\ngrammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the\\nbasis of computational language structure.\\n\\nModern  deep  learning  techniques  for  NLP  include  word  embedding  (representing  words,  typically  as\\nvectors  encoding  their  meaning),[52]  transformers  (a  deep  learning  architecture  using  an  attention\\nmechanism),[53] and others.[54] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models\\nbegan to generate coherent text,[55][56] and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on\\nthe bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications.[57]\\n\\nPerception\\n\\nMachine  perception  is  the  ability  to  use  input  from  sensors  (such  as  cameras,  microphones,  wireless\\nsignals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is\\nthe ability to analyze visual input.[58]\\n\\nincludes  speech  recognition,[59] \\nThe  field \\nrecognition,[61]object tracking,[62] and robotic perception.[63]\\n\\nimage  classification,[60]  facial  recognition,  object\\n\\nSocial intelligence\\n\\nis  an \\n\\ninterdisciplinary  umbrella \\n\\nAffective  computing \\nthat\\ncomprises  systems  that  recognize,  interpret,  process,  or  simulate\\nhuman feeling, emotion, and mood.[65] For example, some virtual\\nassistants  are  programmed  to  speak  conversationally  or  even  to\\nbanter  humorously;  it  makes  them  appear  more  sensitive  to  the\\nemotional  dynamics  of  human  interaction,  or  to  otherwise\\nfacilitate human–computer interaction.\\n\\nHowever, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception\\nof  the  intelligence  of  existing  computer  agents.[66]  Moderate\\nsuccesses related to affective computing include textual sentiment\\nanalysis  and,  more  recently,  multimodal  sentiment  analysis,\\nwherein  AI  classifies  the  affects  displayed  by  a  videotaped\\nsubject.[67]\\n\\nKismet, a robot head which was\\nmade in the 1990s; it is a machine\\nthat can recognize and simulate\\nemotions.[64]\\n\\nGeneral intelligence\\n\\n\\x0cA  machine  with  artificial  general  intelligence  should  be  able  to  solve  a  wide  variety  of  problems  with\\nbreadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.[4]\\n\\nTechniques\\n\\nAI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.[b]\\n\\nSearch and optimization\\nAI  can  solve  many  problems  by  intelligently  searching  through  many  possible  solutions.[68]  There  are\\ntwo very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search.\\n\\nState space search\\nState space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state.[69] For example,\\nplanning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal,\\na process called means-ends analysis.[70]\\n\\nSimple exhaustive searches[71] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the\\nnumber of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow\\nor never completes.[15] \"Heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to\\nreach a goal.[72]\\n\\nAdversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of\\npossible moves and counter-moves, looking for a winning position.[73]\\n\\nLocal search\\n\\nLocal search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a\\nproblem.  It  begins  with  some  form  of  guess  and  refines  it\\nincrementally.[74]\\n\\nGradient  descent  is  a  type  of  local  search  that  optimizes  a  set  of\\nnumerical  parameters  by \\nto\\nminimize  a  loss  function.  Variants  of  gradient  descent  are\\ncommonly used to train neural networks.[75]\\n\\nincrementally  adjusting \\n\\nthem \\n\\nAnother  type  of  local  search  is  evolutionary  computation,  which\\naims  to  iteratively  improve  a  set  of  candidate  solutions  by\\n\"mutating\"  and  \"recombining\"  them,  selecting  only  the  fittest  to\\nsurvive each generation.[76]\\n\\nIllustration of gradient descent for 3\\ndifferent starting points; two\\nparameters (represented by the plan\\ncoordinates) are adjusted in order to\\nminimize the loss function (the\\nheight)\\n\\n\\x0cDistributed  search  processes  can  coordinate  via  swarm  intelligence  algorithms.  Two  popular  swarm\\nalgorithms  used  in  search  are  particle  swarm  optimization  (inspired  by  bird  flocking)  and  ant  colony\\noptimization (inspired by ant trails).[77]\\n\\nLogic\\nFormal  logic  is  used  for  reasoning  and  knowledge  representation.[78]  Formal  logic  comes  in  two  main\\nforms:  propositional  logic  (which  operates  on  statements  that  are  true  or  false  and  uses  logical\\nconnectives  such  as  \"and\",  \"or\",  \"not\"  and  \"implies\")[79]  and  predicate  logic  (which  also  operates  on\\nobjects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as \"Every X is a Y\" and \"There are some Xs that\\nare Ys\").[80]\\n\\nDeductive  reasoning  in  logic  is  the  process  of  proving  a  new  statement  (conclusion)  from  other\\nstatements  that  are  given  and  assumed  to  be  true  (the  premises).[81]  Proofs  can  be  structured  as  proof\\ntrees,  in  which  nodes  are  labelled  by  sentences,  and  children  nodes  are  connected  to  parent  nodes  by\\ninference rules.\\n\\nGiven a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root\\nnode is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms. In\\nthe  case  of  Horn  clauses,  problem-solving  search  can  be  performed  by  reasoning  forwards  from  the\\npremises or backwards from the problem.[82] In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order\\nlogic,  resolution  is  a  single,  axiom-free  rule  of  inference,  in  which  a  problem  is  solved  by  proving  a\\ncontradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.[83]\\n\\nInference  in  both  Horn  clause  logic  and  first-order  logic  is  undecidable,  and  therefore  intractable.\\nHowever,  backward  reasoning  with  Horn  clauses,  which  underpins  computation  in  the  logic\\nprogramming  language  Prolog,  is  Turing  complete.  Moreover,  its  efficiency  is  competitive  with\\ncomputation in other symbolic programming languages.[84]\\n\\nFuzzy  logic  assigns  a  \"degree  of  truth\"  between  0  and  1.  It  can  therefore  handle  propositions  that  are\\nvague and partially true.[85]\\n\\nNon-monotonic  logics,  including  logic  programming  with  negation  as  failure,  are  designed  to  handle\\ndefault reasoning.[28] Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex\\ndomains.\\n\\nProbabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning\\n\\nMany  problems  in AI  (including  in  reasoning,  planning,  learning,  perception,  and  robotics)  require  the\\nagent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools\\nto solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.[86] Precise mathematical\\ntools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory,\\ndecision  analysis,[87]  and  information  value  theory.[88]  These  tools  include  models  such  as  Markov\\ndecision processes,[89] dynamic decision networks,[90] game theory and mechanism design.[91]\\n\\nBayesian  networks[92]  are  a  tool  that  can  be  used  for  reasoning  (using  the  Bayesian  inference\\nalgorithm),[g][94] learning (using the expectation–maximization algorithm),[h][96] planning (using decision\\nnetworks)[97] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).[90]\\n\\n\\x0cProbabilistic  algorithms  can  also  be  used\\nfor  filtering,  prediction,  smoothing,  and\\nfinding  explanations  for  streams  of  data,\\nthus  helping  perception  systems  analyze\\nprocesses that occur over time (e.g., hidden\\nMarkov models or Kalman filters).[90]\\n\\nClassifiers and statistical\\nlearning methods\\n\\nA simple Bayesian network, with the associated conditional\\nprobability tables\\n\\nThe  simplest  AI  applications  can  be\\ndivided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if\\nshiny  then  diamond\"),  on  one  hand,  and\\ncontrollers  (e.g.,  \"if  diamond  then  pick\\nup\"), on the other hand. Classifiers[98] are functions that use\\npattern  matching  to  determine  the  closest  match.  They  can\\nbe  fine-tuned  based  on  chosen  examples  using  supervised\\nlearning.  Each  pattern  (also  called  an  \"observation\")  is\\nlabeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations\\ncombined  with  their  class  labels  are  known  as  a  data  set.\\nWhen  a  new  observation  is  received,  that  observation  is\\nclassified based on previous experience.[45]\\n\\nThere are many kinds of classifiers in use.[99] The decision\\ntree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine\\nlearning  algorithm.[100]  K-nearest  neighbor  algorithm  was\\nthe most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and\\nKernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM)\\ndisplaced  k-nearest  neighbor  in  the  1990s.[101]  The  naive\\nBayes  classifier  is  reportedly  the  \"most  widely  used\\nlearner\"[102]  at  Google,  due  in  part  to  its  scalability.[103]\\nNeural networks are also used as classifiers.[104]\\n\\nExpectation–maximization clustering of Old\\nFaithful eruption data starts from a random\\nguess but then successfully converges on\\nan accurate clustering of the two physically\\ndistinct modes of eruption.\\n\\nArtificial neural networks\\n\\nAn  artificial  neural  network  is  based  on  a  collection  of  nodes  also  known  as  artificial  neurons,  which\\nloosely  model  the  neurons  in  a  biological  brain.  It  is  trained  to  recognise  patterns;  once  trained,  it  can\\nrecognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output.\\nEach node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to\\nthe next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.[104]\\n\\nLearning  algorithms  for  neural  networks  use  local  search  to  choose  the  weights  that  will  get  the  right\\noutput  for  each  input  during  training.  The  most  common  training  technique  is  the  backpropagation\\nalgorithm.[105]  Neural  networks  learn  to  model  complex  relationships  between  inputs  and  outputs  and\\nfind patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.[106]\\n\\n\\x0cIn  feedforward  neural  networks  the  signal  passes  in  only  one\\ndirection.[107]  Recurrent  neural  networks  feed  the  output  signal\\nback into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous\\ninput  events.  Long  short  term  memory  is  the  most  successful\\nnetwork  architecture  for  recurrent  networks.[108]  Perceptrons[109]\\nuse only a single layer of neurons; deep learning[110] uses multiple\\nlayers.  Convolutional  neural  networks  strengthen  the  connection\\nbetween neurons that are \"close\" to each other—this is especially\\nimportant in image processing, where a local set of neurons must\\nidentify an \"edge\" before the network can identify an object.[111]\\n\\nA neural network is an\\ninterconnected group of nodes, akin\\nto the vast network of neurons in the\\nhuman brain.\\n\\nDeep learning\\nDeep  learning[110]  uses  several  layers  of  neurons  between  the  network\\'s\\ninputs  and  outputs. The  multiple  layers  can  progressively  extract  higher-\\nlevel features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower\\nlayers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts\\nrelevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces.[112]\\n\\nspeech \\n\\nrecognition,  natural \\n\\nlanguage  processing, \\n\\nDeep  learning  has  profoundly  improved  the  performance  of  programs  in\\nmany  important  subfields  of  artificial  intelligence,  including  computer\\nvision, \\nimage\\nclassification,[113]  and  others. The  reason  that  deep  learning  performs  so\\nwell in so many applications is not known as of 2023.[114] The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–\\n2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and\\nbackpropagation  had  been  described  by  many  people,  as  far  back  as  the  1950s)[i]  but  because  of  two\\nfactors:  the  incredible  increase  in  computer  power  (including  the  hundred-fold  increase  in  speed  by\\nswitching  to  GPUs)  and  the  availability  of  vast  amounts  of  training  data,  especially  the  giant  curated\\ndatasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet.[j]\\n\\nGPT\\n\\nGenerative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on\\nthe semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pretrained on a large\\ncorpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token\\nbeing  usually  a  word,  subword,  or  punctuation).  Throughout  this  pretraining,  GPT  models  accumulate\\nknowledge  about  the  world  and  can  then  generate  human-like  text  by  repeatedly  predicting  the  next\\ntoken.  Typically,  a  subsequent  training  phase  makes  the  model  more  truthful,  useful,  and  harmless,\\nusually  with  a  technique  called  reinforcement  learning  from  human  feedback  (RLHF).  Current  GPT\\nmodels  are  prone  to  generating  falsehoods  called  \"hallucinations\",  although  this  can  be  reduced  with\\nRLHF and quality data. They are used in chatbots, which allow people to ask a question or request a task\\nin simple text.[122][123]\\n\\n\\x0cCurrent  models  and  services  include  Gemini  (formerly  Bard),  ChatGPT,  Grok,  Claude,  Copilot,  and\\nLLaMA.[124]  Multimodal  GPT  models  can  process  different  types  of  data  (modalities)  such  as  images,\\nvideos, sound, and text.[125]\\n\\nHardware and software\\n\\nIn  the  late  2010s,  graphics  processing  units  (GPUs)  that  were  increasingly  designed  with  AI-specific\\nenhancements  and  used  with  specialized  TensorFlow  software  had  replaced  previously  used  central\\nprocessing  unit  (CPUs)  as  the  dominant  means  for  large-scale  (commercial  and  academic)  machine\\nlearning models\\' training.[126] Specialized programming languages such as Prolog were used in early AI\\nresearch,[127] but general-purpose programming languages like Python have become predominant.[128]\\n\\nThe  transistor  density  in  integrated  circuits  has  been  observed  to  roughly  double  every  18  months—a\\ntrend  known  as  Moore\\'s  law,  named  after  the  Intel  co-founder  Gordon  Moore,  who  first  identified  it.\\nImprovements in GPUs have been even faster.[129]\\n\\nApplications\\n\\nAI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including:\\nsearch  engines  (such  as  Google  Search),  targeting  online  advertisements,  recommendation  systems\\n(offered  by  Netflix,  YouTube  or  Amazon),  driving  internet  traffic,  targeted  advertising  (AdSense,\\nFacebook), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa), autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and\\nself-driving  cars),  automatic  language  translation  (Microsoft  Translator,  Google  Translate),  facial\\nrecognition (Apple\\'s Face ID or Microsoft\\'s DeepFace and Google\\'s FaceNet) and image labeling (used\\nby Facebook, Apple\\'s iPhoto and TikTok). The deployment of AI may be overseen by a Chief automation\\nofficer (CAO).\\n\\nHealth and medicine\\n\\nThe  application  of AI  in  medicine  and  medical  research  has  the  potential  to  increase  patient  care  and\\nquality  of  life.[130]  Through  the  lens  of  the  Hippocratic  Oath,  medical  professionals  are  ethically\\ncompelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients.[131][132]\\n\\nFor medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data. This is particularly\\nimportant  for  organoid  and  tissue  engineering  development  which  use  microscopy  imaging  as  a  key\\ntechnique  in  fabrication.[133]  It  has  been  suggested  that  AI  can  overcome  discrepancies  in  funding\\nallocated to different fields of research.[133] New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically\\nrelevant  pathways.  For  example, AlphaFold  2  (2021)  demonstrated  the  ability  to  approximate,  in  hours\\nrather  than  months,  the  3D  structure  of  a  protein.[134]  In  2023,  it  was  reported  that  AI-guided  drug\\ndiscovery  helped  find  a  class  of  antibiotics  capable  of  killing  two  different  types  of  drug-resistant\\nbacteria.[135] In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson\\'s disease\\n\\n\\x0cdrug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-\\nsynuclein  (the  protein  that  characterises  Parkinson\\'s  disease).  They  were  able  to  speed  up  the  initial\\nscreening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold.[136][137]\\n\\nGames\\n\\nGame  playing  programs  have  been  used  since  the  1950s  to  demonstrate  and  test  AI\\'s  most  advanced\\ntechniques.[138] Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess\\nchampion,  Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.[139] In 2011, in a  Jeopardy!  quiz show exhibition match,\\nIBM\\'s question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter\\nand Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.[140] In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a\\nmatch  with  Go  champion  Lee  Sedol,  becoming  the  first  computer  Go-playing  system  to  beat  a\\nprofessional Go player without handicaps. Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player\\nin  the  world.[141]  Other  programs  handle  imperfect-information  games,  such  as  the  poker-playing\\nprogram  Pluribus.[142]  DeepMind  developed  increasingly  generalistic  reinforcement  learning  models,\\nsuch as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games.[143] In 2019, DeepMind\\'s\\nAlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game\\nthat involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map.[144] In 2021, an AI agent competed in a\\nPlayStation  Gran  Turismo  competition,  winning  against  four  of  the  world\\'s  best  Gran  Turismo  drivers\\nusing  deep  reinforcement  learning.[145]  In  2024,  Google  DeepMind  introduced  SIMA,  a  type  of  AI\\ncapable  of  autonomously  playing  nine  previously  unseen  open-world  video  games  by  observing  screen\\noutput, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions.[146]\\n\\nMathematics\\n\\nIn mathematics, special forms of formal step-by-step reasoning are used. In contrast, LLMs such as GPT-\\n4 Turbo, Gemini Ultra, Claude Opus, LLaMa-2 or Mistral Large are working with probabilistic models,\\nwhich  can  produce  wrong  answers  in  the  form  of  hallucinations. Therefore,  they  need  not  only  a  large\\ndatabase  of  mathematical  problems  to  learn  from  but  also  methods  such  as  supervised  fine-tuning  or\\ntrained  classifiers  with  human-annotated  data  to  improve  answers  for  new  problems  and  learn  from\\ncorrections.[147]  A  2024  study  showed  that  the  performance  of  some  language  models  for  reasoning\\ncapabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with\\nonly minor deviations from trained data.[148]\\n\\nAlternatively,  dedicated  models  for  mathematic  problem  solving  with  higher  precision  for  the  outcome\\nincluding  proof  of  theorems  have  been  developed  such  as  Alpha  Tensor,  Alpha  Geometry  and  Alpha\\nProof all from Google DeepMind,[149] Llemma from eleuther[150] or Julius.[151]\\n\\nWhen  natural  language  is  used  to  describe  mathematical  problems,  converters  transform  such  prompts\\ninto a formal language such as Lean to define mathematic tasks.\\n\\nSome models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark\\ntests, others to serve as educational tools in mathematics.[152]\\n\\nFinance\\n\\n\\x0cFinance  is  one  of  the  fastest  growing  sectors  where  applied  AI  tools  are  being  deployed:  from  retail\\nonline banking to investment advice and insurance, where automated \"robot advisers\" have been in use\\nfor some years.[153]\\n\\nWorld  Pensions  experts  like  Nicolas  Firzli  insist  it  may  be  too  early  to  see  the  emergence  of  highly\\ninnovative AI-informed financial products and services: \"the deployment of AI tools will simply further\\nautomatise things: destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking, financial planning, and pension advice\\nin  the  process,  but  I\\'m  not  sure  it  will  unleash  a  new  wave  of  [e.g.,  sophisticated]  pension\\ninnovation.\"[154]\\n\\nMilitary\\nVarious  countries  are  deploying AI  military  applications.[155] The  main  applications  enhance  command\\nand  control,  communications,  sensors,  integration  and  interoperability.[156]  Research  is  targeting\\nintelligence  collection  and  analysis, \\ninformation  operations,  and\\nsemiautonomous  and  autonomous  vehicles.[155]  AI  technologies  enable  coordination  of  sensors  and\\neffectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination\\nand  deconfliction  of  distributed  Joint  Fires  between  networked  combat  vehicles  involving  manned  and\\nunmanned teams.[156] AI was incorporated into military operations in Iraq and Syria.[155]\\n\\nlogistics,  cyber  operations, \\n\\nIn November 2023, US Vice President Kamala Harris disclosed a declaration signed by 31 nations to set\\nguardrails  for  the  military  use  of  AI.

These agents can interact with users,\\ntheir environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants,\\nchatbots, autonomous vehicles, game-playing systems, and industrial robotics. AI agents operate within\\n\\n\\x0cthe constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This\\nmeans  they  are  restricted  to  performing  tasks  within  their  defined  scope  and  have  finite  memory  and\\nprocessing  capabilities.  In  real-world  applications,  AI  agents  often  face  time  constraints  for  decision-\\nmaking and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve\\ntheir performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt\\nto new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks.[165][166][167]\\n\\nOther industry-specific tasks\\n\\nThere  are  also  thousands  of  successful  AI  applications  used  to  solve  specific  problems  for  specific\\nindustries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated \"AI\" in\\nsome  offerings  or  processes.[168]  A  few  examples  are  energy  storage,  medical  diagnosis,  military\\nlogistics,  applications  that  predict  the  result  of  judicial  decisions,  foreign  policy,  or  supply  chain\\nmanagement.\\n\\nAI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing. AI has been used to investigate if\\nand  how  people  evacuated  in  large  scale  and  small  scale  evacuations  using  historical  data  from  GPS,\\nvideos  or  social  media.  Further,  AI  can  provide  real  time  information  on  the  real  time  evacuation\\nconditions.[169][170][171]\\n\\nIn agriculture, AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments\\nor increasing yield. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development.

Additionally, it could be used for activities in space, such as space exploration, including the\\nanalysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance,\\nand more autonomous operation.\\n\\nDuring the 2024 Indian elections, US$50 millions was spent on authorized AI-generated content, notably\\nby creating deepfakes of allied (including sometimes deceased) politicians to better engage with voters,\\nand by translating speeches to various local languages.[172]\\n\\nEthics\\n\\nAI has potential benefits and potential risks.[173] AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for\\nserious problems: Demis Hassabis of Deep Mind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve\\neverything  else\".[174]  However,  as  the  use  of  AI  has  become  widespread,  several  unintended\\n\\n\\x0cconsequences and risks have been identified.[175] In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics\\nand bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable\\nin deep learning.[176]\\n\\nRisks and harm\\n\\nPrivacy and copyright\\n\\nMachine learning algorithms require large amounts of data.

The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI\\'s ability to process and combine vast amounts of\\ndata, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and\\nanalyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency.\\n\\nSensitive  user  data  collected  may  include  online  activity  records,  geolocation  data,  video  or  audio.[177]\\nFor example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private\\nconversations  and  allowed  temporary  workers  to  listen  to  and  transcribe  some  of  them.[178]  Opinions\\nabout this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is\\nclearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy.[179]\\n\\nAI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications. and have developed several\\ntechniques  that  attempt  to  preserve  privacy  while  still  obtaining  the  data,  such  as  data  aggregation,  de-\\nidentification  and  differential  privacy.[180]  Since  2016,  some  privacy  experts,  such  as  Cynthia  Dwork,\\nhave begun to view privacy in terms of fairness. Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted \"from\\nthe question of \\'what they know\\' to the question of \\'what they\\'re doing with it\\'.\"[181]\\n\\nGenerative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or\\ncomputer code; the output is then used under the rationale of \"fair use\". Experts disagree about how well\\nand under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include\\n\"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market\\nfor  the  copyrighted  work\".[182][183] Website  owners  who  do  not  wish  to  have  their  content  scraped  can\\nindicate  it  in  a  \"robots.txt\"  file.[184]  In  2023,  leading  authors  (including  John  Grisham  and  Jonathan\\nFranzen)  sued  AI  companies  for  using  their  work  to  train  generative  AI.[185][186]  Another  discussed\\napproach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure\\nfair attribution and compensation for human authors.[187]\\n\\nDominance by tech giants\\n\\nThe  commercial AI  scene  is  dominated  by  Big Tech  companies  such  as Alphabet  Inc., Amazon, Apple\\nInc., Meta Platforms, and Microsoft.[188][189][190] Some of these players already own the vast majority of\\nexisting cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers, allowing them to entrench further in\\nthe marketplace.[191][192]\\n\\nSubstantial power needs and other environmental impacts\\n\\n\\x0cIn January 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast\\nto  2026,  forecasting  electric  power  use.[193]  This  is  the  first  IEA  report  to  make  projections  for  data\\ncenters and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power\\ndemand  for  these  uses  might  double  by  2026,  with  additional  electric  power  usage  equal  to  electricity\\nused by the whole Japanese nation.[194]\\n\\nProdigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuels use, and might delay\\nclosings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of\\ndata centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon)\\ninto  voracious  consumers  of  electric  power.  Projected  electric  consumption  is  so  immense  that  there  is\\nconcern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the\\nelectrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources – from nuclear\\nenergy  to  geothermal  to  fusion.  The  tech  firms  argue  that  –  in  the  long  view  – AI  will  be  eventually\\nkinder  to  the  environment,  but  they  need  the  energy  now. AI  makes  the  power  grid  more  efficient  and\\n\"intelligent\", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to\\ntechnology firms.[195]\\n\\nA  2024  Goldman  Sachs  Research  Paper,  AI  Data  Centers  and  the  Coming  US  Power  Demand  Surge,\\nfound \"US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation....\" and forecasts that,\\nby 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for\\nthe electrical power generation industry by a variety of means.[196] Data centers\\' need for more and more\\nelectrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that\\nAI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all.[197]\\n\\nIn  2024,  the  Wall  Street  Journal  reported  that  big AI  companies  have  begun  negotiations  with  the  US\\nnuclear  power  providers  to  provide  electricity  to  the  data  centers.  In  March  2024 Amazon  purchased  a\\nPennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for $650 Million (US).[198]\\n\\nIn September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three\\nMile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the\\nplant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in\\n1979,  will  require  Constellation  to  get  through  strict  regulatory  processes  which  will  include  extensive\\nsafety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If approved (this will be the first ever US\\nre-commissioning  of  a  nuclear  plant),  over  835  megawatts  of  power  –  enough  for  800,000  homes  –  of\\nenergy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at $1.6 billion (US) and is\\ndependent  on  tax  breaks  for  nuclear  power  contained  in  the  2022  US  Inflation  Reduction Act.[199] The\\nUS  government  and  the  state  of  Michigan  are  investing  almost  $2  billion  (US)  to  reopen  the  Palisades\\nNuclear  reactor  on  Lake  Michigan.  Closed  since  2022,  the  plant  is  planned  to  be  reopened  in  October\\n2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a\\nnuclear  proponent  and  former  CEO  of  Exelon  who  was  responsible  for  Exelon  spinoff  of\\nConstellation.[200]\\n\\nMisinformation\\n\\nYouTube,  Facebook  and  others  use  recommender  systems  to  guide  users  to  more  content.  These  AI\\nprograms were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people\\nwatching). The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme\\npartisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch\\n\\n\\x0cmore content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple\\nversions of the same misinformation.[201] This convinced many users that the misinformation was true,\\nand ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government.[202] The AI program had\\ncorrectly  learned  to  maximize  its  goal,  but  the  result  was  harmful  to  society. After  the  U.S.  election  in\\n2016, major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem .\\n\\nIn 2022, generative AI began to create images, audio, video and text that are indistinguishable from real\\nphotographs, recordings, films, or human writing. It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to\\ncreate  massive  amounts  of  misinformation  or  propaganda.[203]  AI  pioneer  Geoffrey  Hinton  expressed\\nconcern about AI enabling \"authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates\" on a large scale, among\\nother risks.[204]\\n\\nAlgorithmic bias and fairness\\nMachine learning applications will be biased[k] if they learn from biased data.[206] The developers may\\nnot be aware that the bias exists.[207] Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by\\nthe way a model is deployed.[208][206] If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously\\nharm  people  (as  it  can  in  medicine,  finance,  recruitment,  housing  or  policing)  then  the  algorithm  may\\ncause discrimination.[209] The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases.\\n\\nOn June 28, 2015, Google Photos\\'s new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a\\nfriend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few\\nimages of black people,[210] a problem called \"sample size disparity\".[211] Google \"fixed\" this problem by\\npreventing  the  system  from  labelling  anything  as  a  \"gorilla\".  Eight  years  later,  in  2023,  Google  Photos\\nstill could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and\\nAmazon.[212]\\n\\nCOMPAS  is  a  commercial  program  widely  used  by  U.S.  courts  to  assess  the  likelihood  of  a  defendant\\nbecoming  a  recidivist.  In  2016,  Julia Angwin  at  ProPublica  discovered  that  COMPAS  exhibited  racial\\nbias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for\\nboth whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the\\nsystem  consistently  overestimated  the  chance  that  a  black  person  would  re-offend  and  would\\nunderestimate  the  chance  that  a  white  person  would  not  re-offend.[213]  In  2017,  several  researchers[l]\\nshowed  that  it  was  mathematically  impossible  for  COMPAS  to  accommodate  all  possible  measures  of\\nfairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.[215]\\n\\nA program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature\\n(such  as  \"race\"  or  \"gender\").  The  feature  will  correlate  with  other  features  (like  \"address\",  \"shopping\\nhistory\"  or  \"first  name\"),  and  the  program  will  make  the  same  decisions  based  on  these  features  as  it\\nwould  on  \"race\"  or  \"gender\".[216]  Moritz  Hardt  said  \"the  most  robust  fact  in  this  research  area  is  that\\nfairness through blindness doesn\\'t work.\"[217]\\n\\nCriticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that\\nare only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes\\nthe results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will\\nbe made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations, some of these\\n\\n\\x0c\"recommendations\"  will  likely  be  racist.[218]  Thus,  machine  learning  is  not  well  suited  to  help  make\\ndecisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. It is descriptive rather\\nthan prescriptive.[m]\\n\\nBias  and  unfairness  may  go  undetected  because  the  developers  are  overwhelmingly  white  and  male:\\namong AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.[211]\\n\\nThere are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on\\nethical  assumptions,  and  are  influenced  by  beliefs  about  society.  One  broad  category  is  distributive\\nfairness,  which  focuses  on  the  outcomes,  often  identifying  groups  and  seeking  to  compensate  for\\nstatistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative\\nstereotypes or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather\\nthan the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of\\nAI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult\\nfor companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also\\nconsidered  by  many AI  ethicists  to  be  necessary  in  order  to  compensate  for  biases,  but  it  may  conflict\\nwith anti-discrimination laws.[205]\\n\\nAt  its  2022  Conference  on  Fairness,  Accountability,  and  Transparency  (ACM  FAccT  2022),  the\\nAssociation  for  Computing  Machinery,  in  Seoul,  South  Korea,  presented  and  published  findings  that\\nrecommend  that  until  AI  and  robotics  systems  are  demonstrated  to  be  free  of  bias  mistakes,  they  are\\nunsafe,  and  the  use  of  self-learning  neural  networks  trained  on  vast,  unregulated  sources  of  flawed\\ninternet data should be curtailed.[220]\\n\\nLack of transparency\\nMany AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions.[221]\\nParticularly  with  deep  neural  networks,  in  which  there  are  a  large  amount  of  non-linear  relationships\\nbetween inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist.[222]\\n\\nIt is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works.\\nThere have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless\\nlearned  something  different  than  what  the  programmers  intended.  For  example,  a  system  that  could\\nidentify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to\\nclassify images with a ruler as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to\\nshow  the  scale.[223]  Another  machine  learning  system  designed  to  help  effectively  allocate  medical\\nresources  was  found  to  classify  patients  with  asthma  as  being  at  \"low  risk\"  of  dying  from  pneumonia.\\nHaving  asthma  is  actually  a  severe  risk  factor,  but  since  the  patients  having  asthma  would  usually  get\\nmuch  more  medical  care,  they  were  relatively  unlikely  to  die  according  to  the  training  data.  The\\ncorrelation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.[224]\\n\\nPeople who have been harmed by an algorithm\\'s decision have a right to an explanation.[225] Doctors, for\\nexample,  are  expected  to  clearly  and  completely  explain  to  their  colleagues  the  reasoning  behind  any\\ndecision  they  make.  Early  drafts  of  the  European  Union\\'s  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  in  2016\\nincluded  an  explicit  statement  that  this  right  exists.[n]  Industry  experts  noted  that  this  is  an  unsolved\\nproblem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has\\nno solution, the tools should not be used.[226]\\n\\n\\x0cDARPA established the XAI (\"Explainable Artificial Intelligence\") program in 2014 to try to solve these\\nproblems.[227]\\n\\nSeveral approaches aim to address the transparency problem. SHAP enables to visualise the contribution\\nof  each  feature  to  the  output.[228]  LIME  can  locally  approximate  a  model\\'s  outputs  with  a  simpler,\\ninterpretable model.[229] Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target\\nclassification.  These  other  outputs  can  help  developers  deduce  what  the  network  has  learned.[230]\\nDeconvolution,  DeepDream  and  other  generative  methods  can  allow  developers  to  see  what  different\\nlayers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the\\nnetwork is learning.[231] For generative pre-trained transformers, Anthropic developed a technique based\\non  dictionary  learning  that  associates  patterns  of  neuron  activations  with  human-understandable\\nconcepts.[232]\\n\\nBad actors and weaponized AI\\n\\nArtificial  intelligence  provides  a  number  of  tools  that  are  useful  to  bad  actors,  such  as  authoritarian\\ngovernments, terrorists, criminals or rogue states.\\n\\nA lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human\\nsupervision.[o] Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous\\nweapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction.[234] Even when used\\nin  conventional  warfare,  it  is  unlikely  that  they  will  be  unable  to  reliably  choose  targets  and  could\\npotentially  kill  an  innocent  person.[234]  In  2014,  30  nations  (including  China)  supported  a  ban  on\\nautonomous weapons under the United Nations\\' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however\\nthe United States and others disagreed.[235] By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching\\nbattlefield robots.[236]\\n\\nAI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways.\\nFace  and  voice  recognition  allow  widespread  surveillance.  Machine  learning,  operating  this  data,  can\\nclassify  potential  enemies  of  the  state  and  prevent  them  from  hiding.  Recommendation  systems  can\\nprecisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in\\nproducing  misinformation.  Advanced  AI  can  make  authoritarian  centralized  decision  making  more\\ncompetitive  than  liberal  and  decentralized  systems  such  as  markets.  It  lowers  the  cost  and  difficulty  of\\ndigital  warfare  and  advanced  spyware.[237]  All  these  technologies  have  been  available  since  2020  or\\nearlier—AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China.[238][239]\\n\\nThere many other ways that AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen. For\\nexample,  machine-learning  AI  is  able  to  design  tens  of  thousands  of  toxic  molecules  in  a  matter  of\\nhours.[240]\\n\\nTechnological unemployment\\n\\nEconomists  have  frequently  highlighted  the  risks  of  redundancies  from  AI,  and  speculated  about\\nunemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.[241]\\n\\nIn  the  past,  technology  has  tended  to  increase  rather  than  reduce  total  employment,  but  economists\\nacknowledge  that  \"we\\'re  in  uncharted  territory\"  with  AI.[242]  A  survey  of  economists  showed\\ndisagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-\\n\\n\\x0cterm  unemployment,  but  they  generally  agree  that  it  could  be  a  net  benefit  if  productivity  gains  are\\nredistributed.[243]  Risk  estimates  vary;  for  example,  in  the  2010s,  Michael  Osborne  and  Carl  Benedikt\\nFrey  estimated  47%  of  U.S.  jobs  are  at  \"high  risk\"  of  potential  automation,  while  an  OECD  report\\nclassified  only  9%  of  U.S.  jobs  as  \"high  risk\".[p][245]  The  methodology  of  speculating  about  future\\nemployment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology,\\nrather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies.[241] In April 2023, it was\\nreported  that  70%  of  the  jobs  for  Chinese  video  game  illustrators  had  been  eliminated  by  generative\\nartificial intelligence.[246][247]\\n\\nUnlike  previous  waves  of  automation,  many  middle-class  jobs  may  be  eliminated  by  artificial\\nintelligence;  The  Economist  stated  in  2015  that  \"the  worry  that AI  could  do  to  white-collar  jobs  what\\nsteam  power  did  to  blue-collar  ones  during  the  Industrial  Revolution\"  is  \"worth  taking  seriously\".[248]\\nJobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for\\ncare-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.[249]\\n\\nFrom the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example,\\nthose put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually\\nshould be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative\\ncalculation and qualitative, value-based judgement.[250]\\n\\nExistential risk\\n\\nIt  has  been  argued AI  will  become  so  powerful  that  humanity  may  irreversibly  lose  control  of  it.  This\\ncould, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \"spell the end of the human race\".[251] This scenario has been\\ncommon in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\"\\n(or  \"sentience\"  or  \"consciousness\")  and  becomes  a  malevolent  character.[q]  These  sci-fi  scenarios  are\\nmisleading in several ways.\\n\\nFirst, AI does not require human-like \"sentience\" to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given\\nspecific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if\\none gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it\\n(he used the example of a paperclip factory manager).[253] Stuart Russell gives the example of household\\nrobot  that  tries  to  find  a  way  to  kill  its  owner  to  prevent  it  from  being  unplugged,  reasoning  that  \"you\\ncan\\'t fetch the coffee if you\\'re dead.\"[254] In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have\\nto be genuinely aligned with humanity\\'s morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".[255]\\n\\nSecond, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an\\nexistential  risk.  The  essential  parts  of  civilization  are  not  physical.  Things  like  ideologies,  law,\\ngovernment,  money  and  the  economy  are  made  of  language;  they  exist  because  there  are  stories  that\\nbillions  of  people  believe.  The  current  prevalence  of  misinformation  suggests  that  an  AI  could  use\\nlanguage to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.[256]\\n\\nThe opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and\\nunconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI.[257] Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill\\nGates,  and  Elon  Musk,[258]  as  well  as  AI  pioneers  such  as  Yoshua  Bengio,  Stuart  Russell,  Demis\\nHassabis, and Sam Altman, have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI.\\n\\n\\x0cIn May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to \"freely speak\\nout  about  the  risks  of AI\"  without  \"considering  how  this  impacts  Google.\"[259]  He  notably  mentioned\\nrisks  of  an AI  takeover,[260]  and  stressed  that  in  order  to  avoid  the  worst  outcomes,  establishing  safety\\nguidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI.[261]\\n\\nIn 2023, many leading AI experts issued the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI\\nshould be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\".[262]\\n\\nOther researchers, however, spoke in favor of a less dystopian view. AI pioneer Juergen Schmidhuber did\\nnot sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human\\nlives longer and healthier and easier.\"[263] While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can\\nalso  be  used  by  bad  actors,  \"they  can  also  be  used  against  the  bad  actors.\"[264][265]  Andrew  Ng  also\\nargued  that  \"it\\'s  a  mistake  to  fall  for  the  doomsday  hype  on AI—and  that  regulators  who  do  will  only\\nbenefit  vested  interests.\"[266]  Yann  LeCun  \"scoffs  at  his  peers\\'  dystopian  scenarios  of  supercharged\\nmisinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\"[267] In the early 2010s, experts argued that the\\nrisks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective\\nof a superintelligent machine.[268] However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible\\nsolutions became a serious area of research.[269]\\n\\nEthical machines and alignment\\n\\nFriendly AI  are  machines  that  have  been  designed  from  the  beginning  to  minimize  risks  and  to  make\\nchoices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI\\nshould be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI\\nbecomes an existential risk.[270]\\n\\nMachines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field\\nof  machine  ethics  provides  machines  with  ethical  principles  and  procedures  for  resolving  ethical\\ndilemmas.[271] The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,[271] and was founded at\\nan AAAI symposium in 2005.[272]\\n\\nOther  approaches  include  Wendell  Wallach\\'s  \"artificial  moral  agents\"[273]  and  Stuart  J.  Russell\\'s  three\\nprinciples for developing provably beneficial machines.[274]\\n\\nOpen source\\nActive  organizations  in  the  AI  open-source  community  include  Hugging  Face,[275]  Google,[276]\\nEleutherAI  and  Meta.[277] Various AI  models,  such  as  Llama  2,  Mistral  or  Stable  Diffusion,  have  been\\nmade  open-weight,[278][279]  meaning  that  their  architecture  and  trained  parameters  (the  \"weights\")  are\\npublicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned, which allows companies to specialize\\nthem with their own data and for their own use-case.[280] Open-weight models are useful for research and\\ninnovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as\\nobjecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn\\n\\n\\x0cthat  future AI  models  may  develop  dangerous  capabilities  (such  as  the  potential  to  drastically  facilitate\\nbioterrorism) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They\\nrecommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses.[281]\\n\\nFrameworks\\n\\nArtificial  Intelligence  projects  can  have  their  ethical  permissibility  tested  while  designing,  developing,\\nand implementing an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework containing the\\nSUM values—developed by the Alan Turing Institute tests projects in four main areas:[282][283]\\n\\nRespect the dignity of individual people\\nConnect with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively\\nCare for the wellbeing of everyone\\nProtect social values, justice, and the public interest\\n\\nOther developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference,\\nthe  Montreal  Declaration  for  Responsible AI,  and  the  IEEE\\'s  Ethics  of Autonomous  Systems  initiative,\\namong others;[284] however, these principles do not go without their criticisms, especially regards to the\\npeople chosen contributes to these frameworks.[285]\\n\\nPromotion  of  the  wellbeing  of  the  people  and  communities  that  these  technologies  affect  requires\\nconsideration  of  the  social  and  ethical  implications  at  all  stages  of AI  system  design,  development  and\\nimplementation,  and  collaboration  between  job  roles  such  as  data  scientists,  product  managers,  data\\nengineers, domain experts, and delivery managers.[286]\\n\\nThe  UK AI  Safety  Institute  released  in  2024  a  testing  toolset  called  \\'Inspect\\'  for AI  safety  evaluations\\navailable under a MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with\\nthird-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge,\\nability to reason, and autonomous capabilities.[287]\\n\\nRegulation\\n\\nThe  regulation  of  artificial  intelligence  is  the  development\\nof  public  sector  policies  and  laws  for  promoting  and\\nregulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation\\nof  algorithms.[288] The  regulatory  and  policy  landscape  for\\nAI  is  an  emerging  issue  in  jurisdictions  globally.[289]\\nAccording  to  AI  Index  at  Stanford,  the  annual  number  of\\nAI-related  laws  passed  in  the  127  survey  countries  jumped\\nfrom  one  passed \\nin  2022\\nalone.[290][291]  Between  2016  and  2020,  more  than  30\\ncountries adopted dedicated strategies for AI.[292] Most EU\\nmember  states  had  released  national  AI  strategies,  as  had\\nCanada,  China,  India,  Japan,  Mauritius, \\nthe  Russian\\nFederation,  Saudi Arabia,  United Arab  Emirates,  U.S.,  and\\nVietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia\\nand Tunisia.[292] The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a\\nneed  for AI  to  be  developed  in  accordance  with  human  rights  and  democratic  values,  to  ensure  public\\n\\nThe first global AI Safety Summit was held\\nin 2023 with a declaration calling for\\ninternational co-operation.\\n\\nto  37  passed \\n\\nin  2016 \\n\\n\\x0cconfidence  and  trust  in  the  technology.[292]  Henry  Kissinger,  Eric  Schmidt,  and  Daniel  Huttenlocher\\npublished a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI.[293]\\nIn 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they\\nbelieve  may  happen  in  less  than  10  years.[294]  In  2023,  the  United  Nations  also  launched  an  advisory\\nbody  to  provide  recommendations  on  AI  governance;  the  body  comprises  technology  company\\nexecutives,  governments  officials  and  academics.[295]  In  2024,  the  Council  of  Europe  created  the  first\\ninternational  legally  binding  treaty  on AI,  called  the  \"Framework  Convention  on Artificial  Intelligence\\nand Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law\". It was adopted by the European Union, the United\\nStates, the United Kingdom, and other signatories.[296]\\n\\nIn a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only\\n35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\".[290]\\nA 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to\\nhumanity.[297] In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional\\n41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding\\n\"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\".[298][299]\\n\\nIn November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the\\nnear and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks.[300]\\n28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start\\nof  the  summit,  calling  for  international  co-operation  to  manage  the  challenges  and  risks  of  artificial\\nintelligence.[301][302] In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit, 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety\\ncommitments on the development of AI.[303][304]\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nThe study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity.\\nThe study of logic led directly to Alan Turing\\'s theory of computation, which suggested that a machine,\\nby  shuffling  symbols  as  simple  as  \"0\"  and  \"1\",  could  simulate  any  conceivable  form  of  mathematical\\nreasoning.[305][306]  This,  along  with  concurrent  discoveries  in  cybernetics,  information  theory  and\\nneurobiology,  led  researchers  to  consider  the  possibility  of  building  an  \"electronic  brain\".[r]  They\\ndeveloped  several  areas  of  research  that  would  become  part  of AI,[308]  such  as  McCullouch  and  Pitts\\ndesign  for  \"artificial  neurons\"  in  1943,[115]  and  Turing\\'s  influential  1950  paper  \\'Computing  Machinery\\nand  Intelligence\\',  which  introduced  the  Turing  test  and  showed  that  \"machine  intelligence\"  was\\nplausible.[309][306]\\n\\nThe  field  of AI  research  was  founded  at  a  workshop  at  Dartmouth  College  in  1956.[s][6] The  attendees\\nbecame  the  leaders  of AI  research  in  the  1960s.[t]  They  and  their  students  produced  programs  that  the\\npress described as \"astonishing\":[u] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems\\nin  algebra,  proving  logical  theorems  and  speaking  English.[v][7] Artificial  intelligence  laboratories  were\\nset up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.[306]\\n\\nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in\\ncreating  a  machine  with  general  intelligence  and  considered  this  the  goal  of  their  field.[313]  In  1965\\nHerbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can\\ndo\".[314]  In  1967  Marvin  Minsky  agreed,  writing  that  \"within  a  generation  ...  the  problem  of  creating\\n\\n\\x0c\\'artificial intelligence\\' will substantially be solved\".[315] They had, however, underestimated the difficulty\\nof  the  problem.[w]  In  1974,  both  the  U.S.  and  British  governments  cut  off  exploratory  research  in\\nresponse to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill[317] and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress to fund\\nmore  productive  projects.[318]  Minsky\\'s  and  Papert\\'s  book  Perceptrons  was  understood  as  proving  that\\nartificial  neural  networks  would  never  be  useful  for  solving  real-world  tasks,  thus  discrediting  the\\napproach altogether.[319] The \"AI winter\", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult,\\nfollowed.[9]\\n\\nIn the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,[320] a form of\\nAI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for\\nAI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan\\'s fifth generation computer project inspired\\nthe U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research.[8] However, beginning with\\nthe collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-\\nlasting winter began.[10]\\n\\nUp  to  this  point,  most  of AI\\'s  funding  had  gone  to  projects  that  used  high-level  symbols  to  represent\\nmental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt\\nthat this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception,\\nrobotics,  learning  and  pattern  recognition,[321]  and  began  to  look  into  \"sub-symbolic\"  approaches.[322]\\nRodney Brooks rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that\\nmove and survive.[x] Judea Pearl, Lofti Zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and\\nuncertain  information  by  making  reasonable  guesses  rather  than  precise  logic.[86][327]  But  the  most\\nimportant  development  was  the  revival  of  \"connectionism\",  including  neural  network  research,  by\\nGeoffrey  Hinton  and  others.[328]  In  1990,  Yann  LeCun  successfully  showed  that  convolutional  neural\\nnetworks  can  recognize  handwritten  digits,  the  first  of  many  successful  applications  of  neural\\nnetworks.[329]\\n\\nAI  gradually  restored  its  reputation  in  the  late  1990s  and  early  21st  century  by  exploiting  formal\\nmathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This \"narrow\" and \"formal\"\\nfocus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics,\\neconomics  and  mathematics).[330]  By  2000,  solutions  developed  by AI  researchers  were  being  widely\\nused, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\" (a tendency known as\\nthe  AI  effect).[331]  However,  several  academic  researchers  became  concerned  that  AI  was  no  longer\\npursuing  its  original  goal  of  creating  versatile,  fully  intelligent  machines.  Beginning  around  2002,  they\\nfounded  the  subfield  of  artificial  general  intelligence  (or  \"AGI\"),  which  had  several  well-funded\\ninstitutions by the 2010s.[4]\\n\\nDeep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.[11]\\nFor  many  specific  tasks,  other  methods  were  abandoned.[y]  Deep  learning\\'s  success  was  based  on  both\\nhardware  improvements  (faster  computers,[333]  graphics  processing  units,  cloud  computing[334])  and\\naccess to large amounts of data[335] (including curated datasets,[334] such as ImageNet). Deep learning\\'s\\nsuccess  led  to  an  enormous  increase  in  interest  and  funding  in AI.[z]  The  amount  of  machine  learning\\nresearch (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019.[292]\\n\\nIn  2016,  issues  of  fairness  and  the  misuse  of  technology  were  catapulted  into  center  stage  at  machine\\nlearning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-\\nfocussed  their  careers  on  these  issues.  The  alignment  problem  became  a  serious  field  of  academic\\n\\n\\x0cstudy.[269]\\n\\nIn  the  late  teens  and  early  2020s,  AGI  companies  began  to  deliver  programs  that  created  enormous\\ninterest. In 2015, AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the world champion Go player. The program\\nwas taught only the rules of the game and developed strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model\\nthat  was  released  in  2020  by  OpenAI  and  is  capable  of  generating  high-quality  human-like  text.[336]\\nThese  programs,  and  others,  inspired  an  aggressive AI  boom,  where  large  companies  began  investing\\nbillions in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about $50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around\\n2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized\\nin \"AI\".[337] About 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022.[338]\\n\\nPhilosophy\\n\\nPhilosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make\\nintelligent  machines.[339]  Another  major  focus  has  been  whether  machines  can  be  conscious,  and  the\\nassociated  ethical  implications.[340]  Many  other  topics  in  philosophy  are  relevant  to  AI,  such  as\\nepistemology  and  free  will.[341]  Rapid  advancements  have  intensified  public  discussions  on  the\\nphilosophy and ethics of AI.[340]\\n\\nDefining artificial intelligence\\nAlan  Turing  wrote  in  1950  \"I  propose  to  consider  the  question  \\'can  machines  think\\'?\"[342]  He  advised\\nchanging the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to\\nshow intelligent behaviour\".[342] He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to\\nsimulate  human  conversation.[309]  Since  we  can  only  observe  the  behavior  of  the  machine,  it  does  not\\nmatter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these\\nthings about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.\"[343]\\n\\nRussell  and  Norvig  agree  with  Turing  that  intelligence  must  be\\ndefined  in  terms  of  external  behavior,  not  internal  structure.[1]\\nHowever,  they  are  critical  that  the  test  requires  the  machine  to\\nimitate humans. \"Aeronautical engineering texts,\" they wrote, \"do\\nnot  define  the  goal  of  their  field  as  making  \\'machines  that  fly  so\\nexactly  like  pigeons  that  they  can  fool  other  pigeons.\\' \"[345]  AI\\nfounder \\nthat  \"Artificial\\nintelligence \\nis  not,  by  definition,  simulation  of  human\\nintelligence\".[346]\\n\\nJohn  McCarthy  agreed,  writing \\n\\nMcCarthy  defines  intelligence  as  \"the  computational  part  of  the\\nability  to  achieve  goals  in  the  world\".[347]  Another  AI  founder,\\nMarvin Minsky similarly describes it as \"the ability to solve hard\\nproblems\".[348] The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of\\nagents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined\\ngoals.[1]  These  definitions  view  intelligence  in  terms  of  well-defined  problems  with  well-defined\\n\\nThe Turing test can provide some\\nevidence of intelligence, but it\\npenalizes non-human intelligent\\nbehavior.[344]\\n\\n\\x0csolutions,  where  both  the  difficulty  of  the  problem  and  the  performance  of  the  program  are  direct\\nmeasures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may\\nnot even be possible.\\n\\nAnother definition has been adopted by Google,[349] a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition\\nstipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to\\nthe way it is defined in biological intelligence.\\n\\nSome authors have suggested in practice, that the definition of AI is vague and difficult to define, with\\ncontention  as  to  whether  classical  algorithms  should  be  categorised  as  AI,[350]  with  many  companies\\nduring  the  early  2020s AI  boom  using  the  term  as  a  marketing  buzzword,  often  even  if  they  did  \"not\\nactually use AI in a material way\".[351]\\n\\nEvaluating approaches to AI\\nNo  established  unifying  theory  or  paradigm  has  guided  AI  research  for  most  of  its  history.[aa]  The\\nunprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much\\nso  that  some  sources,  especially  in  the  business  world,  use  the  term  \"artificial  intelligence\"  to  mean\\n\"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow. Critics\\nargue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.\\n\\nSymbolic AI and its limits\\nSymbolic AI (or \"GOFAI\")[353] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they\\nsolve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\"\\ntasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems\\nhypothesis:  \"A  physical  symbol  system  has  the  necessary  and  sufficient  means  of  general  intelligent\\naction.\"[354]\\n\\nHowever,  the  symbolic  approach  failed  on  many  tasks  that  humans  solve  easily,  such  as  learning,\\nrecognizing  an  object  or  commonsense  reasoning.  Moravec\\'s  paradox  is  the  discovery  that  high-level\\n\"intelligent\"  tasks  were  easy  for  AI,  but  low  level  \"instinctive\"  tasks  were  extremely  difficult.[355]\\nPhilosopher  Hubert  Dreyfus  had  argued  since  the  1960s  that  human  expertise  depends  on  unconscious\\ninstinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than\\nexplicit  symbolic  knowledge.[356]  Although  his  arguments  had  been  ridiculed  and  ignored  when  they\\nwere first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.[ab][16]\\n\\nThe issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that\\nhuman intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research\\ninto  symbolic  AI  will  still  be  necessary  to  attain  general  intelligence,[358][359]  in  part  because  sub-\\nsymbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a\\nmodern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial\\nintelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches.\\n\\nNeat vs. scruffy\\n\\n\\x0c\"Neats\"  hope  that  intelligent  behavior  is  described  using  simple,  elegant  principles  (such  as  logic,\\noptimization, or neural networks). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of\\nunrelated  problems.  Neats  defend  their  programs  with  theoretical  rigor,  scruffies  rely  mainly  on\\nincremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s,[360] but\\neventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both.\\n\\nSoft vs. hard computing\\nFinding  a  provably  correct  or  optimal  solution  is  intractable  for  many  important  problems.[15]  Soft\\ncomputing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are\\ntolerant  of  imprecision,  uncertainty,  partial  truth  and  approximation.  Soft  computing  was  introduced  in\\nthe late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with\\nneural networks.\\n\\nNarrow vs. general AI\\n\\nAI  researchers  are  divided  as  to  whether  to  pursue  the  goals  of  artificial  general  intelligence  and\\nsuperintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these\\nsolutions  will  lead  indirectly  to  the  field\\'s  long-term  goals.[361][362]  General  intelligence  is  difficult  to\\ndefine and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific\\nproblems  with  specific  solutions.  The  sub-field  of  artificial  general  intelligence  studies  this  area\\nexclusively.\\n\\nMachine consciousness, sentience, and mind\\n\\nThe philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental\\nstates,  in  the  same  sense  that  human  beings  do.  This  issue  considers  the  internal  experiences  of  the\\nmachine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because\\nit  does  not  affect  the  goals  of  the  field:  to  build  machines  that  can  solve  problems  using  intelligence.\\nRussell and Norvig add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way\\nhumans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\"[363] However, the question has become central to\\nthe philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction.\\n\\nConsciousness\\n\\nDavid  Chalmers  identified  two  problems  in  understanding  the  mind,  which  he  named  the  \"hard\"  and\\n\"easy\"  problems  of  consciousness.[364]  The  easy  problem  is  understanding  how  the  brain  processes\\nsignals,  makes  plans  and  controls  behavior.  The  hard  problem  is  explaining  how  this  feels  or  why  it\\nshould feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something\\n(Dennett\\'s consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human information processing is easy\\nto explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-\\nblind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear\\nwhat would be required for the person to know what red looks like.[365]\\n\\nComputationalism and functionalism\\n\\n\\x0cComputationalism  is  the  position  in  the  philosophy  of  mind  that  the  human  mind  is  an  information\\nprocessing  system  and  that  thinking  is  a  form  of  computing.  Computationalism  argues  that  the\\nrelationship  between  mind  and  body  is  similar  or  identical  to  the  relationship  between  software  and\\nhardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem. This philosophical position was inspired\\nby  the  work  of  AI  researchers  and  cognitive  scientists  in  the  1960s  and  was  originally  proposed  by\\nphilosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.[366]\\n\\nPhilosopher  John  Searle  characterized  this  position  as  \"strong  AI\":  \"The  appropriately  programmed\\ncomputer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human\\nbeings have minds.\"[ac] Searle counters this assertion with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to\\nshow that, even if a machine perfectly simulates human behavior, there is still no reason to suppose it also\\nhas a mind.[370]\\n\\nAI welfare and rights\\n\\nIt is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel),\\nand if so, to what degree.[371] But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer,\\nthen  it  may  be  entitled  to  certain  rights  or  welfare  protection  measures,  similarly  to  animals.[372][373]\\nSapience  (a  set  of  capacities  related  to  high  intelligence,  such  as  discernment  or  self-awareness)  may\\nprovide  another  moral  basis  for AI  rights.[372]  Robot  rights  are  also  sometimes  proposed  as  a  practical\\nway to integrate autonomous agents into society.[374]\\n\\nIn 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI\\nsystems.  Similarly  to  the  legal  status  of  companies,  it  would  have  conferred  rights  but  also\\nresponsibilities.[375]  Critics  argued  in  2018  that  granting  rights  to  AI  systems  would  downplay  the\\nimportance  of  human  rights,  and  that  legislation  should  focus  on  user  needs  rather  than  speculative\\nfuturistic  scenarios.  They  also  noted  that  robots  lacked  the  autonomy  to  take  part  to  society  on  their\\nown.[376][377]\\n\\nProgress  in AI  increased  interest  in  the  topic.  Proponents  of AI  welfare  and  rights  often  argue  that AI\\nsentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot\\nanalogous to slavery or factory farming, which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created\\nand carelessly exploited.[373][372]\\n\\nFuture\\n\\nSuperintelligence and the singularity\\n\\nA  superintelligence  is  a  hypothetical  agent  that  would  possess  intelligence  far  surpassing  that  of  the\\nbrightest  and  most  gifted  human  mind.[362]If  research  into  artificial  general  intelligence  produced\\nsufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software\\nwould be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an \"intelligence explosion\" and\\nVernor Vinge called a \"singularity\".[378]\\n\\n\\x0cHowever,  technologies  cannot  improve  exponentially  indefinitely,  and  typically  follow  an  S-shaped\\ncurve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.[379]\\n\\nTranshumanism\\n\\nRobot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted\\nthat humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than\\neither.  This  idea,  called  transhumanism,  has  roots  in  the  writings  of  Aldous  Huxley  and  Robert\\nEttinger.[380]\\n\\nEdward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution\", an idea first proposed by\\nSamuel  Butler\\'s  \"Darwin  among  the  Machines\"  as  far  back  as  1863,  and  expanded  upon  by  George\\nDyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence.[381]\\n\\nIn fiction\\n\\nThought-capable  artificial  beings  have  appeared  as\\nstorytelling  devices  since  antiquity,[382]  and  have  been  a\\npersistent theme in science fiction.[383]\\n\\nA common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley\\'s\\nFrankenstein,  where  a  human  creation  becomes  a  threat  to\\nits masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke\\'s\\nand Stanley Kubrick\\'s 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968),\\nwith  HAL  9000,  the  murderous  computer  in  charge  of  the\\nDiscovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984)\\nand  The  Matrix  (1999).  In  contrast,  the  rare  loyal  robots\\nsuch as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and\\nBishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.[384]\\n\\nThe word \"robot\" itself was coined by Karel\\nČapek in his 1921 play R.U.R., the title\\nstanding for \"Rossum\\'s Universal Robots\".\\n\\nIsaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the \"Multivac\"\\nsuper-intelligent  computer.  Asimov\\'s  laws  are  often  brought  up  during  lay  discussions  of  machine\\nethics;[385]  while  almost  all  artificial  intelligence  researchers  are  familiar  with  Asimov\\'s  laws  through\\npopular  culture,  they  generally  consider  the  laws  useless  for  many  reasons,  one  of  which  is  their\\nambiguity.[386]\\n\\nSeveral works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing\\nus artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek\\'s R.U.R.,\\nthe films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric\\nSheep?, by Philip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered\\nby technology created with artificial intelligence.[387]\\n\\nSee also\\n\\nArtificial general intelligence\\n\\n\\x0cArtificial intelligence content detection – Software to detect AI-generated content\\nBehavior selection algorithm – Algorithm that selects actions for intelligent agents\\nBusiness process automation – Automation of business processes\\nCase-based reasoning – Process of solving new problems based on the solutions of similar\\npast problems\\nComputational intelligence – Ability of a computer to learn a specific task from data or\\nexperimental observation\\nDigital immortality – Hypothetical concept of storing a personality in digital form\\nEmergent algorithm – Algorithm exhibiting emergent behavior\\nFemale gendering of AI technologies – Gender biases in digital technology\\nGlossary of artificial intelligence – List of definitions of terms and concepts commonly used\\nin the study of artificial intelligence\\nIntelligence amplification – Use of information technology to augment human intelligence\\nMind uploading – Hypothetical process of digitally emulating a brain\\nMoravec\\'s paradox – Observation that perception requires more computation than\\nreasoning\\nOrganoid intelligence – Use of brain cells and brain organoids for intelligent computing\\nRobotic process automation – Form of business process automation technology\\nWeak artificial intelligence – Form of artificial intelligence\\nWetware computer – Computer composed of organic material\\nHallucination (artificial intelligence) – Erroneous material generated by AI\\n\\nExplanatory notes\\n\\na.

It is among the reasons that expert systems proved to be inefficient for capturing\\n\\nknowledge.[30][31]\\n\\nd. \"Rational agent\" is general term used in economics, philosophy and theoretical artificial\\n\\nintelligence. It can refer to anything that directs its behavior to accomplish goals, such as a\\nperson, an animal, a corporation, a nation, or in the case of AI, a computer program.\\ne. Alan Turing discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper\\n\\n\"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\".[42] In 1956, at the original Dartmouth AI summer\\nconference, Ray Solomonoff wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning:\\n\"An Inductive Inference Machine\".[43]\\n\\nf. See AI winter § Machine translation and the ALPAC report of 1966\\ng. Compared with symbolic logic, formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive. For\\n\\ninference to be tractable, most observations must be conditionally independent of one\\nanother. AdSense uses a Bayesian network with over 300 million edges to learn which ads\\nto serve.[93]\\n\\nh. Expectation–maximization, one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning, allows\\n\\nclustering in the presence of unknown latent variables.[95]\\n\\n\\x0ci. Some form of deep neural networks (without a specific learning algorithm) were described\\n\\nby: Warren S. McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943)[115] Alan Turing (1948);[116] Karl Steinbuch\\nand Roger David Joseph (1961).[117] Deep or recurrent networks that learned (or used\\ngradient descent) were developed by: Frank Rosenblatt(1957);[116] Oliver Selfridge\\n(1959);[117] Alexey Ivakhnenko and Valentin Lapa (1965);[118] Kaoru Nakano (1971);[119]\\nShun-Ichi Amari (1972);[119] John Joseph Hopfield (1982).[119] Precursors to\\nbackpropagation were developed by: Henry J. Kelley (1960);[116] Arthur E. Bryson\\n(1962);[116] Stuart Dreyfus (1962);[116] Arthur E. Bryson and Yu-Chi Ho (1969);[116]\\nBackpropagation was independently developed by: Seppo Linnainmaa (1970);[120] Paul\\nWerbos (1974).[116]\\n\\nj. Geoffrey Hinton said, of his work on neural networks in the 1990s, \"our labeled datasets\\n\\nwere thousands of times too small. [And] our computers were millions of times too slow.\"[121]\\n\\nk. In statistics, a bias is a systematic error or deviation from the correct value. But in the\\n\\ncontext of fairness, it refers to a tendency in favor or against a certain group or individual\\ncharacteristic, usually in a way that is considered unfair or harmful. A statistically unbiased\\nAI system that produces disparate outcomes for different demographic groups may thus be\\nviewed as biased in the ethical sense.[205]\\n\\nl. Including Jon Kleinberg (Cornell University), Sendhil Mullainathan (University of Chicago),\\n\\nCynthia Chouldechova (Carnegie Mellon) and Sam Corbett-Davis (Stanford)[214]\\nm. Moritz Hardt (a director at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems) argues that\\n\\nmachine learning \"is fundamentally the wrong tool for a lot of domains, where you\\'re trying\\nto design interventions and mechanisms that change the world.\"[219]\\n\\nn. When the law was passed in 2018, it still contained a form of this provision.\\no. This is the United Nations\\' definition, and includes things like land mines as well.[233]\\np. See table 4; 9% is both the OECD average and the U.S. average.[244]\\nq. Sometimes called a \"robopocalypse\"[252]\\nr. \"Electronic brain\" was the term used by the press around this time.[305][307]\\ns. Daniel Crevier wrote, \"the conference is generally recognized as the official birthdate of the\\n\\nnew science.\"[310] Russell and Norvig called the conference \"the inception of artificial\\nintelligence.\"[115]\\n\\nt. Russell and Norvig wrote \"for the next 20 years the field would be dominated by these\\n\\npeople and their students.\"[311]\\n\\nu. Russell and Norvig wrote \"it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything kind of\\n\\nsmartish\".[312]\\n\\nv. The programs described are Arthur Samuel\\'s checkers program for the IBM 701, Daniel\\n\\nBobrow\\'s STUDENT, Newell and Simon\\'s Logic Theorist and Terry Winograd\\'s SHRDLU.\\nw. Russell and Norvig write: \"in almost all cases, these early systems failed on more difficult\\n\\nproblems\"[316]\\n\\nx. Embodied approaches to AI[323] were championed by Hans Moravec[324] and Rodney\\nBrooks[325] and went by many names: Nouvelle AI.[325] Developmental robotics.[326]\\n\\ny. Matteo Wong wrote in The Atlantic: \"Whereas for decades, computer-science fields such as\\n\\nnatural-language processing, computer vision, and robotics used extremely different\\nmethods, now they all use a programming method called \"deep learning.\" As a result, their\\ncode and approaches have become more similar, and their models are easier to integrate\\ninto one another.\"[332]\\n\\n\\x0cz. Jack Clark wrote in Bloomberg: \"After a half-decade of quiet breakthroughs in artificial\\n\\nintelligence, 2015 has been a landmark year. Computers are smarter and learning faster\\nthan ever\", and noted that the number of software projects that use machine learning at\\nGoogle increased from a \"sporadic usage\" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects in 2015.[334]\\naa. Nils Nilsson wrote in 1983: \"Simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI\\n\\nis all about.\"[352]\\n\\nab. Daniel Crevier wrote that \"time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of\\n\\nDreyfus\\'s comments. Had he formulated them less aggressively, constructive actions they\\nsuggested might have been taken much earlier.\"[357]\\n\\nac. Searle presented this definition of \"Strong AI\" in 1999.[367] Searle\\'s original formulation was\\n\"The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers\\ngiven the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive\\nstates.\"[368] Strong AI is defined similarly by Russell and Norvig: \"Stong AI – the assertion\\nthat machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking).\"[369]\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.
